Comin over in my direction
So thankful for that, its such a blessin, yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long
!Oh! Tu, tu eres el iman y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso 
Ya, ya me esta gustando mas de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo mas
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningun apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estas conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le ensenes a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos 
Dejame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido
Si te pido un beso, ven, damelo, yo se que estas pensandolo
Llevo tiempo intentandolo, mami, esto es dando y dandolo
Sabes que tu corazon conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba esta buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver como te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuanto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, despues salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tu me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa montarlo aqui tengo la pieza
!Oye!
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estas conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le ensenes a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos 
Dejame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, !Ay, Bendito!
I can move forever cuando este contigo
!Bailalo!
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le ensenes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido 
Despacito

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think Im cryin on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
I used to believe
We were burnin on the edge of somethin beautiful
Somethin beautiful
Sellin a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, its been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Never let you go, never let me down

Oh baby, baby
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I dont do too well with apologies
I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Ill take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
Ill go, Ill go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?

Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I dont do well with the drama

The pimps and the players say, Dont go crushin
Wise men say fools rush in
But I dont know 
They say were too young and
The pimps and the players say, Dont go crushin
Wise men say fools rush in
But I dont know 
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
Im a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they dont see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Lets take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, brides groom, Im my fathers child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Fathers proud 
If you make it to the water, Hell part the clouds 
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud 
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up 
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust 
I know I aint leavin you like I know He aint leavin us 
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second, on God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second, on God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

I had big dreams of doin shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin to act cool, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin me up , liftin me up 
And tearin me down , tearin me down 
Ill take responsibility for everything Ive done 
Holdin it against me like youre the holy one 
I had a chip on my shoulder, had to let it go
Cause unforgiveness keeps them in control
I came in with good intentions, then I let it go
And now I really wanna know
What if I, what if I trip? 
What if I, what if I fall? 
Then am I the monster? 
Just let me know 
And what if I, what if I sin? 
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah 
Then am I the monster? 
Just let me know 
La-da-da-duh-duh 
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-da-duh-duh
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-duh-duh 
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-da-duh-duh 
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
Everybody knows my name now
But somethin bout it still feels strange
Like lookin in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when Im older, itll all calm down
But its killin me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then youd know me
Cause Ive had everything
But no ones listening
And thats just fuckin lonely
Im so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe thats the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then youd know me
Cause Ive had everything
But no ones listening
And thats just fuckin lonely
Im so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Im so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

I need you, I need the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-
You the m-, the m-, the m-
I need you the most
I gave you the key when the door wasnt open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now Im all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now? 
Where are you now that I need ya? Couldnt find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didnt leave ya 
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya? 
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin? To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin, thats for sure 
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin, oh Lord
Where are you now that I need ya?

You're the reason I believe in love
Its been difficult for me to trust 
And I'm afraid that Ima fuck it up

Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I cant live without you
So, baby, stay

Yeah, you, if its not you, its not anyone 
Lookin back on my life, youre the only good Ive ever done 
Yeah, you, if its not you, its not anyone
Feeling like Im breathing my last breath
Feeling like Im walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears Ive wept
Look at all the promises that Ive kept
I put my all into your hands
Heres my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
Youre not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift
That Ive ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, youve given me purpose
Thinking my journeys come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
Im more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirits at ease
I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
Youre not hard to reach
And youve given me the best gift
That Ive ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way
Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything
I don't know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it's wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You can't be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that's not who you are. You know you're trying to be the best you can be, but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
That's what happening with me, it's like "God, I'm giving it all I've got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm going to do it." And it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding that's how it is
If Im out at the bar havin a night on the town
Life of the party, pourin shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I dont turn around
Would you say, Hi? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didnt mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didnt even comment
If the songs werent true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?
Oh, dont go reaching out
Cause you cant have everything
Your head and your heart wont feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time
Dont check on me
If were not together, then its probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It aint always summer in June
Might run across your mind but dont worry bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it aint skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I aint missing sleep, no-oh
Dont take it personal if I cant reply now
Im distant cause I dont wanna be reached now
Wont let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
Im liberated
Energys like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Dont shed no more tears
Wont gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I dont need your pity
Dont check on me
Oh, dont check on me
If were not together, then its probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you
Aint call you back cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldnt mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldnt happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didnt notice
Oh, dont go reaching out
Cause you cant have everything
You cant kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try
Dont check on me
If were not together, then its probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It aint always summer in June
Dont check on me
If were not together, then its probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It aint always summer in June
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go

Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh

Dont nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

Less Im doing it with you
It dont make no sense

Less Im doing it with you
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I aint the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, Im incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How Im supposed to take that?
Bood up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that

Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever youre not in my presence
It feels like Im missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
Til youre back again, oh, yeah, yeah
You think Im biased to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone, and I dont reply
But the next eight bars tell you why
Youre all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Aint worried about nobody else
If I aint with you, I aint myself
You make me complete
Youre all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Whats a king, babe, without a queen?
There aint no I in team
You make me complete, youre all that matters to me
Take the gas out the car, it wont drive
Thats how I feel when youre not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you
Oh-oh, Im grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
Youre the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe
Youre all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Aint worried about nobody else
If I aint with you, I aint myself
You make me complete

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Youre all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Youre all that matters to me
You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
Youre pulling me
Youre pulling me in like youre gravity
Im notorious for thinking youre full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Im trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Cant get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe Im crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least thats what it seems
Could it be I dont know whats good for me?
Im notorious for thinking youre full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Im trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Cant get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe Im crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Im sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
Im standing on the borderline
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Im trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Cant get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe Im crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
You aint gotta answer none of my calls
Im believing youll pick up one day
I dont wanna add to your pain at all
Im praying that time makes a change in your life
Im realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I dont wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Dont nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what Im saying is
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, dont rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, dont rush, no pressure
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought Id take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin it, Im so delirious
And Ima put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
Im the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, dont rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Ill be waiting for you
Dont rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, dont rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Dont rush, no pressure
Put my key in the ignition
Dont rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain't got no place to be
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Dont do it, baby
Dont do it to me, no, no
I know you dont wanna talk, right
Weve been on and off like the cross lights
You heard Im playin with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl youre so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
Weve been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know its deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like Im Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But its a waste of time if your waist aint on mine
Think about it
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Dont rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Dont rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now

See I never thought that I could walk through fire 
I never thought that I could take the burn 
I never had the strength to take it higher 
Until I reached the point of no return 
And theres just no turning back
When your hearts under attack
Gonna give everything I have
Its my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight till forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
I never thought that I could feel this power 
I never thought that I could feel this free 
Im strong enough to climb the highest tower 
And Im fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh
Cause theres just no turning back 
When your hearts under attack 
Gonna give everything I have
Cause this is my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight 
I will fight till forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never 
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB
Uh-huh
I gotcha, lil bro
I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now hes bigger than me, taller than me
And hes older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he aint on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood 
I gotta be the best, and yes, were the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moons where I land 
I will never say never, I will fight 
I will fight til forever, to make it right 
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Never say never
I will never say never 
Never say never
I will fight till forever make it right 
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Ne-Never say never 
Ne-Never say never 
Ne-Never say never 
And never say never 
Ne-Never say never 
Ne-Never say never 
Ne-Never say never
And never say never
Sometimes its hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes its hard to face reality
Shouldve been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay away for the last time
Now youre standin right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Tryna protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing, woah, oh
Sometimes its hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes its hard to face reality
Dont be afraid to stand alone
Dont be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know its hard away from home
And it aint easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin to your significant other all night long
Sometimes its hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes its hard to face reality
Sometimes its hard to face reality
Love and death are quite similar
How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kinda hard to face
Like actual facts is for flat-earthers
Rains a requirement for flowers to grow
And pains a requirement for power to grow
Its a miracle how one can change
From one what was just hours ago
Such is life though, its just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Are exactly the same, its macro, micro
Crack your atom and let your light glow
One day, you could be the king of pop
And the next one just be Wacko Michael
Its human nature, just like he told us
Lets face reality, crack the cycle
Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down to your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but dont drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Oh, dont lose your self-esteem
I apologize, for being a man
Its way harder than what it seems
Sometimes its hard to face reality, oh, oh 
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh 
Sometimes its hard to face reality
Sometimes its hard to face reality
You know you can call me if you need someone
Ill pick up the pieces if you come undone
Painting stars up on your ceiling
Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone
I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes 
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
Cause I know how it feels to be someone 
Feels to be someone who loses their way
Youre looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you cant get close 
Painting stars up on your ceiling
Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone
I need you to hold on 
Heaven is a place not too far away 
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes 
Take my hand and hold on 
Tell me everything that you need to say
Cause I know how it feels to be someone
Feels to be someone who loses their way
Midnight til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you 
Midnight til morning

Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes 
Take my hand and hold on 
Tell me everything that you need to say
Cause I know how it feels to be someone 
Feels to be someone who loses their way
Midnight til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you 
Midnight til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin up all alone aint better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin a Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she dont leave me, oh, no
See them heat waves in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin
Been missin the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought Id settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin on bein by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin left
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin up all alone aint better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
When you asked me if I cheated, I said never 
What are you willing to do to stay together? 
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? 
Girl, youre killin me, I dont wanna act like I can fix this 
I dont wanna be the one thats changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I cant buy your love
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin up all alone aint better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
I promise Im gonna love you til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as were driving out the private gate
Countin the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, its bye for now, its just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, lets settle down
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin up all alone aint better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Youngblood thinks theres always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when Im hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I cant follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know
That if I cant be close to you, Ill settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life 
And if you cant be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life
Youngblood thinks theres always tomorrow

I miss you more than life 
And if you cant be next to me, your memory is ecstasy

Girl you say that you dont wanna talk, but its cool
Ive been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone
Girl I know that I dont wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know

Dont tell me youre my heartbreaker

Dont tell me youre my heartbreaker
Cause girl my hearts breaking, heartbreaker
Girl you see me standing here, standing here
Standing in the rain, oh baby

Cause girl my hearts breaking, heartbreaker
Dont tell me youre my heartbreaker
Cause girl my hearts breaking, heartbreaker
So what Im really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasnt been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
Its just personal, this just, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
Im under this umbrella and Im calling your name
And you know I dont wanna lose that, cause I still believe
I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you dont see
Cause what you dont see is when we dont speak I really dont sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if Id have the world in my hands Id give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that Im feeling
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that Im, the way that Im
And you taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart, with your heart
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
Its like youre stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it aint over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesnt mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, its just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But its strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it aint ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesnt mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again
What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I aint perfect, wont deny
My reputations on the line
So Im working on a better me
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again

Suns up and I still aint got no rest
Dont wanna close my eyes, Im scared Ill miss too much
Dont wanna fall asleep, Id rather fall in love
When I cant feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without yous like two months
Dont wanna close my eyes, Im scared Ill miss too much
Dont wanna fall asleep, Id rather fall in love
Cause eternity with you aint long enough
Two seconds without yous like two months
And thats too much
Love the way you love your mom
Take on all your friends problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh
I still relive that second
I met my biggest blessing
Prayed for you, look what God has done
I say I love you under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh

Suns up and I still aint got no rest

I used to believe
We were burnin on the edge of something beautiful
Somethin beautiful
Sellin a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, its been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah

Happy birthday
You aint gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truthll make us relevant
Hurts but its necessary
Dont want us to lose what we are, no
Dont want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
If it aint broke then we dont need to fix it
Believing in that she sayll have you livid
No they wont be happy til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you dont wanna get it
They aint never had your back like I got it
They ain't never had trust like how we got it
So they cant help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Dont question it
You aint gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truthll make us relevant
Hurts but its necessary
Dont want us to lose what we are, no
Dont want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
Its like youre always looking for a problem
But there aint enough equations for you to solve em
So quick to turn nothin right into somethin
Take the numbers out my phone, go head and call em
They ain't ever had my back like you got it
They aint never had a chance, how you got it
So they cant help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, dont question it
You aint gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truthll make us relevant
Hurts but its necessary 
Dont want us to lose what we are
Dont want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
She texts me Hows you love life?
And How are you?, I said Im good
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when Im home
Im serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
Ive accomplished my goals, its only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and Im straight
Esco
You aint gotta question it, oh
You already know the answer
The truthll make us relevant
Hurts but its necessary, yeah
Dont want us to lose what we are
Dont want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
Feeling the reminisce
Gone in an instance
Blink of an eye
No goodbye
I had a notion
Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Oh my
Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
But were the blame
For all the pain
For all the pain
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had the chance
If I had the chance
Id make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you
There repercussion
Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time
Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
Id make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
Id make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you
Lately Ive been thinking, thinking bout what we had
I know it was hard, it was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You know there's no one, I can relate to
And know we won't find a love that's so true
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know Im used to making your day
But that is the past now, we didnt last now
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
Not sure what I was doing before ya
I quit tryna figure it out
Nothin like havin someone for you
Someone beside you when its time to lay down
Fully committed, youre here for the stay down
Look in the mirror, you right for the takedown
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin I cant ignore
I need you all around me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldnt wanna be in any other place
From my home to the road
Ill make sure youre comfortable
You make sure Im comfortable
Our loves unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah
Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself
I never thought I could ever be a spoiler
Guess anything is possible with your help
Anythings possible since you made my heart melt
Gave me the best hand that Id ever been dealt
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin I cant ignore
I need you all around me, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldnt wanna be in any other place
From my home to the road
Ill make sure youre comfortable
You make sure Im comfortable
Our loves unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Feels like times moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I dont go looney over you 
Just trying to amplify the sound
To drown out all of this need for you 
Biting my nails, got me nervous, so anxious
See its one oclock now
Noon felt like three hours ago
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A. 
Out the window, got me looking out the street
Whats your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, whats your E.T.A.?
Whats your E.T.A.?
Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Dont say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like, Where you been?
Love me like you dont want it to end
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A. 
Out the window, got me looking out the street
Whats your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, whats your E.T.A.?
Whats your E.T.A.?
Before you gotta go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location
Thank you, yes, youre less than five minutes away from me
In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna be
Sometimes its hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes its hard to face reality
Dont be afraid to stand alone
Dont be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know its hard away from home
And it aint easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin to your significant other all night long
Sometimes its hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes its hard to face reality
Shouldve been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now youre standin right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing, oh
Sometimes its hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes its hard to face reality

I built in the sand for you when I was two
I thought I painted a picture of Heaven
But it turns out its just your room, just your room
Id run off the end of the earth just to see if youd catch me
When I know youd let me fall every time

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know its hard to be asleep at night
Dont you worry, cause everythings gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Dont you worry, cause everythings gonna be alright
Be alright
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
For you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you

Movin like the blitz , crib like the Ritz 
So you know theres room 
So, baby, please

I know the problem is they bothered by the kid 
Oh, you sent the jet out for me?
You tryna ball harder than me?
Did I come cross your radar?
Cross your mind now and later?
Do you feel like you know me?
Its just a part of nature
Lets ask each other questions
Can we do each other favors?
Would you mind the labor? Baby

To you to you, to you
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you

She ask for seconds, I give her some more and Im proud of myself cause I used to be poor
Now I just hustle and grind and stack it til all of my muscles is sore 
Dont play a sport, but I ball , answer the phone when I call 
I get up whenever I fall, dont try me, its gonna end up in a brawl 
Porsche lights look like a frog , cost a few hundred, thats all 
Richard Mille sit on my wrist, Im big 4L, I dont do shit small 
Ass so fat, cant sit up
Shawty got a load in the back like a pick-up
Quarter million dollars every time I do a pick up
Fans got they arms in the air like a stick-up 
Money growin like it got hiccuped 
You know its some dope if I whip up 
Time is money, lil baby, you beautiful

They say, Time is money, but money cant make no time 
Sometimes its sunny, but sometimes it dont shine

The person that you tell me you love

Nine thousand nine hundred nine and it slipped my hands

No, I dont, no
Gotta need you
I cant breathe without you
Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
Thats where our hearts were safe
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands
Our love is here to stay

When shes around, he feels nothing but joy

Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you dont wanna lose

And I dont think I can stand sitting around while youre hurting babe, so take my hand
Well, did you know youre an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone, every time you done wrong, Im the shoulder youre crying on
And I hope by the time that Im done with this song Ill have figured out
Whats gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all, oh, my love 
But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall

Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times
The times you got back up, woah
Could be a billionaire in a year
Thats how you gotta think til youre there
On the regular
If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
Thats all Im condoning
Love is a component
You're the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment
And dont do nothin less your hearts in it
Hearts in it, hearts in it
Dont do nothin less youre all in it
All in it, all in it
Come again each time
Til the water runs dry
Oh dont do nothin less youre all in it
All in it, all in it
Oh, oh

See, growing up, I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Cause I, I just didnt think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that Id get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasnt gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people arent perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God its like hes perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition

A fiery ball come clashing from the sky
Reports still show no known survivors
Nobody knows what to do, we're all freaking out here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
There's aliens, I'm telling you there's aliens
You said "I come in peace" so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythms on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone
You don't know what they're like, if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
Don't try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting, I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn't have a friend, didn't know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You're my best friend please listen to me
You don't know what they're like, if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
Don't try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting, I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
Greetings, I fell from the sky
I'm from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And our flying saucer crashed, I'm the only one that survived
I've only taking over this planet since I arrived
I'm in a backpack, I'm ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne's world
Reports from witnesses flooded into the police station
Sounds like something out of a movie
After 
First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
UFO 
Nobody knows what to do, we're all freaking out here
We found this but no one can identify it
There's aliens, I'm telling you there's aliens
Don't try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting, I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
In our planet we dont kill one another
We dont take love for granted
Its a gift from the mother and
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace
My friends say Im a fool to think that youre the one for me
I guess Im just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that you know Im never leaving
Cause youre my angel sent from above
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here

Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
Cause they dont get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear Ill put nothing above ya, above ya
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me

Oh, yes, I am 
Im available 
Yeah, for you, I am
Dont mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say Im number one on your to-do list

Nothin like your hands on me
Regret the moments that they're off me and let it sink in
Hear me talkin, dont ignore me
I was just about to call it, what you thinkin?
Been thinkin' bout you, cant get this vision out my head
Got a grip, Im holdin onto every thing you say
Aint makin this up just to get you in my bed
If you aint left, yeah, you can go ahead
Thinkin bout you, it aint always bout me
Dont make any sense in you bein lonely
Hurry up and get here now, but dont speed
Ill never get over you up under me
Im available 
Oh, yes, I am 
Im available 
Yeah, for you, I am
Dont mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say Im number one on your to-do list

Got my arms wide open 
Got my arms wide open 
I get frustrated when youre busy
Lately, thats been more than often, baby, what is this?
Its like, do you even miss me?
Feelin less than priority, you got me convinced
Convinced Im the only one, trippin in my head
Because in reality, you live in my bed
Im supposed to hold onto everything you said
Yes or no question, dont leave it unread
Are you available now?
Oh, here I am, oh, here I am
Are you available? 
Just tell me, Yeah

You know I am
Dont mean to sound desperate

Got my arms wide open
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I havent touched you
Yeah, thats what love is
Thats what true love is
Wouldnt want nobody else by my side
Ooh, and you can trust me
After all the lies I told you
Yeah, thats what love is
Thats what true love is
Dont nobody else deserve my time
I reach out to you, but my hands cant hold enough
Enough of your greatness
You teach me patience
Like the best of our worlds collide
Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
So beyond what lust is
Hey, its a blessing that youre in my life
Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together
Yeah, thats what love is
Now, thats what love is
Dont nobody else deserve my eyes
When you demand my presence, its hard to read the message
I stay on the defense to take away your leverage
Til you put it in perspective
Cant help but to respect it
Oh, now I know what love is
I know what true love is
Yeah, down in my soul
Far more than you know
My self-esteem gets low
You lift it right up through the ceiling, woah
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I havent touched you
Yeah, thats what love is
Now, thats what love is
Wouldnt want nobody else by my side, no

Thats what love is 
Thats what love is 
I appreciate you 
God bless your maker, hey-hey 
Thats what love is 
Thats what love is 
Look at this love

I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
Ive been so high, Ive been so low
Im just tryna find my way back home
Cant help but roam
My signals gone
Guess this journeys left me on my own
I dont care why
Im alone, alone, alone
And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world we set in stone
Im dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that Id be broken
I never thought Id be this far from home
Im dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
Ive been so high, Ive been so low
Im just tryna find my way back home
Cant help but roam
My signals gone

Forget about the way you loved me

If only I could hit the ground
Oh, darlin, theres not much that you can say
To stop me from fallin in like I am
Oh, darlin, even waves cant wash away
Our names in the sand, never could, never can
You are my everything, Id give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I aint gonna run
Every dance is slow, every kiss is woah
They say you know when you know, well, I know, I know youre the one
Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned, it wasnt my turn, it wasnt the right time
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But, baby, you are a lifetime
Oh, darlin, theres no word that can describe
The way that I feel, tonight
Oh, darlin, I would walk that broken road

I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me
I swear I got a hun of these cause baby Im a money tree
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y
Possibly youre probably thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally
Theres a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out I should make history
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory
Cant you see the private jets flying over you?
I aint even notice but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no they shouldnt be a photoshoot
Its funny how you wanna take my picture and its like your first time
Playing with camera claiming that Its not mine
Just calm down, you dont gotta hurry
Dont be nervous, you dont gotta worry
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them Id be blurry
Hey, whats the situation? Woah
Im just tryna make a little conversation
Why the hesitation? Woah
Tell me what your name is, for your information

Dont be so cold, we could be fire
Tomorrow well go, lets start tonight
You know what its all about
I could take you out, I could take you home

Hard work don't mean shit if it aint smart 
Ima run the play up to the max 
So if I dont know you, dont owe you, I gotta tax 
I got enough sense, and I slipped through the cracks 
And, nowadays, I wear my smile like a mask
Im the idols I looked up to in my past
All natural, Doctor Sebi, you gon have to CBD me
I been watchin what they feed me 
I like when she tell me with her body language that she need me 
See my third eye is on Left Eye, I cant let them Eazy-E me
No sir , I don't even do flu shots
Clique with me everywhere I go, so every pic a group shot 
I done wiggled out the noose knot 
They been lyin to me my whole life, I finally found the truth out 
Like they dont gotta love you if they need you 
Got angels and demons on a three-way 
And they ain't comin to no agreement
And I still be feelin broke up, Im gettin money
And my team aint gettin cream until we cremate 
Big headlines, Im talkin CNN 
I see a hatin bitch like, Hi, it's me again 
They like, Why you feel so good? 
Im like, Why I need a reason? 
Lot of salt, lot of shade bein thrown my way, man

But I gotta thank God though
Cause he got me workin harder than my demons 
God got me workin harder than my demons 
God got me workin harder than my, hol up

Luther Vandross, never too much 
Now we two up, who, us?
Yeah, real ones learn the work through us 
Baby girl wanna dance, wanna groove, wanna vibe
But you know my best move is the one where you end up on my side
The ground on the mountain top feel the same as rock-bottom 
Quit my fuckin job, that's when the real work started
Still showed up every mornin, every evenin of every season 
Whats the reason? God got me workin harder than my--
Demon 
Harder than my demons 
Harder than my demons, demons, demons, demons
I been fightin every season
Harder than my demons

Everyones itchin for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, lets make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you dont deserve it, then dont give in
Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, its only right that
All around the world, people want to be loved

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I dont do too well with apologies
I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
(JB and JB
Latino Remix
Leggo)
Quisiera regresar el tiempo y cambiar errores
Se que todo fue mi culpa y te cause dolores
Espero que de volver tu tengas intenciones
Por que hoy estoy aqui extranandote
Okay, tu por mi morias ma
No solo fisica, habia quimica
Yo te llamaba y no querias contestar
Se que fui tonto y no te supe valorar
Entiende mi estilo de vida
Por favor comprende que esto no paso de repente
Si esta en mi manos no lo dejo a la suerte
Solo espero que me perdones
Nena, tengo tantas ganas de amarte
Solo quiero que me perdones
Si tu y yo no podemos estar
Olvida todo, no voy a fallar
Im not just trying to get you back on me
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, Im on the drum, yeah, Im on the snare drum
Yeah, Im on the beat cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat cause Im playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
Im surprised you didnt hear this in the Bible
Im so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so heres a recital
Im so bad like Michael, I know
Im still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
Im the drummer boy, so do it, do it
Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum 
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
Nothing to give our king , pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
Yo, at the table with the family, havin dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though its kinda cold, Im pullin out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, Lets make it hot up in the winter, I said Cool
You know Ima deliver
Lets collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then Im headed to the studio cause aint nothing stopping how
You know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum
If you wanna give, its the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, Im on the snare
Its crazy how some people say they, say they dont care
When theres people on the street with no food, its not fair
Its about time for you to act merrily
Its about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
Cause theyre warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin theres a family out hungry and cold
Wishin, wishin that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, lets change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe
Im the drummer boy so do it, do it
Im the drummer boy so do it, do it
Im the drummer boy so do it, do it
Im the drummer boy so do it, do it
Im the drummer boy so do it, do it

To accept all responsibility

I dont wanna be the same, oh
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me
Dont fight fire with fire
If Im screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that Im facing
Be like serenity, help reposition my mind
Take a chance make a difference, in my life
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me

Its like my hearts bleeding knowing that you dont need me
Shut my heart down, now I dont know what Imma do now

Take the scarf and wrap it around my neck
Loosen up my tie
At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now
One finger at a time, I turn the pages, yeah
Right leg crossed while youre smokin a cigarette
Cameras on the couch, aint nobody takin pictures
Throw my arms around you, bear witness
The stripes on my shirt, can you read between the lines?
You sip champagne while I sip on red wine
Never mind me watchin you, never mind the tension
Please excuse me while I dance, I forgot to mention
Im going on strike
At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment

This is so wrong, I cant go on
Til you believe that that should be me, that should be me
You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
Its funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldnt see you out at the movies? What you doing to me, youre taking him where we used to go
Now if youre tryna break my heart, its working because you know that
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I cant go on
Til you believe that that should be me
I need to know should I fight for love or disarm
Its getting harder to shield this pain in my heart
Oooh

That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I cant go on
Til you believe that that should be me
Holding your hand, that should be me
The one making you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me, that should be me
Never shoulda let you go, I never shoulda let you go
That should be me
Im never gonna let you go
That should be me

Your affections miraculous 
Every promise you make, you keep 
Never met nobody else like this

Goons with me, dressed like skaters

Ladies love me

Killin this track was inevitable

Swaggin with a Krook3d tee
Body slam the beat from D.B, call me Booker T

While them haters go down and we just get to watch 
Amazing, Im blazing

Nobodys facing what Im facing
Set a pace so I can race without pacing
Lace my shoes up, start racing
You can taste it, without fasteing
I mean fasting, start blasting
Call up Lauryn Hill, Doo Wop That Thing
Swagger jacking is not what I do
JB is the man, yeah, hes the truth
Hes a beast when he steps up in the booth
I just landed, I did too
Im a gentleman, yes, Im a gentleman
Im out of my element but Im still elegant
Im full of adrenaline, you know what that means
Louis V high tops with the skinny jeans

Ladies love me, Im on my Cool J 
Ladies love me

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didnt leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
Thats for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying
Oh lord
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didnt leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken
Yes I did
I gave you the key when the door wasnt open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping
Cant deny it
Now Im all alone and my joys turn to moping
Tell me...
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldnt find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didnt leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I think Im falling for you
I think I'm falling for you
If you dont call me, Ill jump off the roof
If you don't call me, Ill jump off the roof
Kennedy called me after school 
I told her I wanna talk to you
Still cant believe thats how we met
Thats one day Ill never forget
I think Im falling for you
I think Im falling for you 
If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof
If you dont call me, I'll jump off the roof 
Kiss my sane mind goodbye, Im bonkers now
Crazy for your love, I do the most
Walk in the street, up to your mamas house
Dirt road with pink skies and rainbows
Oh, Ill climb the tallest mountain
Just to hold your hand and dance around
The thought of you reverbs in my head
And that's why I said
I think Im falling for you
I think Im falling for you
If you dont call me, Ill jump off the roof
If you dont call me, Ill jump off the roof
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hopefully Ill find my mind
Cause I lost it somewhere along the way
Ooh, and I pray that you find the time
Cause theres only so many minutes in the day
Yeah, the thought of you fills me with bliss
Looking forward to making memories we reminisce 
Got a whole lot to risk
Dont take my heart into the abyss
I think Im falling for you 
I think Im falling for you 
If you dont call me, Ill jump off the roof 
If you dont call me, Ill jump off the roof 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your hips and your eyes give me all the summer vibes
When you sing your lullaby to me
We walk through the night and the summer slowly lies
Theres no place Id rather be
And we run up the street
People skippin to the broken beat
Kissing your lips on the trampoline
Girl, I dont know whats gotten into me
I think Im falling for you 
I think Im falling for you 
If you dont call me, Ill jump off the roof 
If you dont call me, Ill jump off the roof 
Your hips and your eyes got the summertime
Oh yeah

Im the type to give you everything I have, shes priceless for real oh
You dont ever have to do a thing but give me all your love and affection, oh
You have something going for yourself, thats the type of girl for me
Take you on a trip right by my side to a special place where we belong
So many things that are on my mind, cant wait to get you all alone
Hey girl, youre something out a magazine
Youre something on a movie screen
Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say
Hey girl, youre something like a silhouette
What you see is what you get
Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say
Ever since you looked into my eyes nothing seems to phase me, oh
Theres no one who ever satisfied, stolen love can make me, oh
Fell the way you do, its something in the way you do
The way you move your body girl
Take you on a trip right by my side to a special place where we belong
So many things that are on my mind, cant wait to get you all alone
Hey girl, youre something out a magazine

Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say
Hey girl, youre something like a silhouette
What you see is what you get
Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say
Youre making promises to someone elses face
If those should break, call out my name
Youre getting high off of some new life that you made
If that high fades, call out my name
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch
Going line for line
At your best friends house
Were only getting better at pretending were okay
And after all this time, we feel the same
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Cards on the table that we never got to play
Oh, what a shame, call out my name
I bet hes cool, but I put fire in your veins
If you miss that flame, call out my name
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch
Going line for line
At your best friends house
Were only getting better at pretending were okay
And after all this time
I know you think about laying side by side
On the goodwill couch 
Going line for line 
At your best friends house
Were only getting better at pretending were okay 
And after all this time, we feel the same
Ooh, ooh

I never thought that itd be easy
Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us, and were wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try
So its up to you and its up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth

I say to you this morning, that if you have never found something so dear and so precious to you that you will die for it, then you arent fit to live
You may be 38 years old as I happen to be
And one day some great opportunity stands before you
And calls upon you to stand up for some great principle
Some great issue, some great cause
And you refuse to do it because you are afraid
You refuse to do it because you want to live longer
Youre afraid that you will lose your job
Or youre afraid that you will be criticized
Or that you will lose your popularity
Or youre afraid that somebody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house
And so you refuse to take the stand
Well, you may go on and live until you are 90
But youre just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90
And the sensation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit
You died when you refused to stand up for right
You died when you refused to stand up for truth
You died when you refused to stand up for justice
With you, with you
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
Now, Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it cant work
Its all fun and games til someone gets hurt
And I dont, I wont let that be you
Now you dont want to let go, and I dont want to let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we dont want to fall, but were tripping in our hearts
And its reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you cant love me here
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause Im still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I dont care, Ive got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
Cause aint no way its going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop
Now you dont want to let go, and I dont want to let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we dont want to fall, but were tripping in our hearts
And its reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you cant love me here
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause Im still stuck in the moment with you
See like just because this cold, cruel world saying we cant be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I aint with it
And I dont want to be so old and grey, reminiscing about these better days
But conventions telling us to let go
So well never know
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause Im still stuck in the moment with you
I always knew you were the best
The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest, the star of my show
So many times I wished youd be the one for me
But never knew youd get like this, girl
Whatd you do to me?
Youre who Im thinking of
And girl, you aint my runner-up
And no matter what, youre always number one
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I cant live without
Thats you, thats you
Youre my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls Ive ever known, its you, its you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl
Youre used to going out your way to impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me
Ill take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
Its a dream that can't be real
So girl, lets write a fairytale and show em how we feel
Youre who Im thinking of
And girl, you aint my runner-up
And no matter what, youre always number one
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I cant live without
Thats you, thats you
Youre my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls Ive ever known, its you, its you
I want you
Its you, its you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite, girl
You take my breath away with everything you say
I just want to be with you, my baby, my baby
Oh-oh, promise Ill play no games

Cause youre the girl of my dreams
My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you

She cant hide away, cause the world knows who we are
She dont like the lights, whoah
She dont, she dont, she dont
She dont like the lights, whoah
She dont, she dont, she dont
Dont wanna share with no one else, want me to herself
Dont want no love in front of the camera
She dont like the lights, whoah
She dont, she dont, she dont
She dont like the lights, whoah
Now shes giving ultimatums
She dont like this life
She said if I loved her

I cant do that
And its getting to the point where its too much for her
Wanna throw it all away, cause its too much for

Yeah, its not easy growin up
You know, mm
Only two years old, I was playin drums on the table
Guess I knew it was the only thing stable
When I was young, I could pick things up quick
Anything that I did, I was pretty good at it
Well, I started school, I was a troublemaker
Thought I knew everything in life, yeah, that caught up to me later, hehe
I had to learn about humility
I had to grow up and accept responsibility, yeah
That wasnt easy, cause at seventeen, I had a milli
Women throwin themselves at me had me goin silly
On the surface, I felt like the man
But deep inside I felt deprived just like an empty can
Ive had everything in life that people strive for 
Just to ask the question: What are we alive for? 
What you believe? And would you agree?
Well, what would you die for? 
Is there a reason? What is the meaning? What do we cry for?
One thing I know is were in this together, together, oh
One thing I know is were in this together, together, oh
Were in this together
I moved out when I was eighteen
I was livin in a mansion doin big things
FBI raided my house and shit was gettin dicey
I was doin stupid shit to get people to like me
All that to say, Im thankful thats not who I am
And Im thankful God was with me when shit hit the fan
Cause Hes the reason that Im still standin
And even in a pandemic, God is still plannin
Plannin peace, plannin joy, plan another day
Gave His life upon the cross to wash our sins away
Ive had everything in life that people strive for
Just to ask the question: What are we alive for?
What you believe? And would you agree?
Well, what would you die for?
Is there a reason? What is the meaning? What do we cry for?
One thing I know is were in this together, together, oh
One thing I know is were in this together, together, oh
Were in this together
I pray for every single person listening to this song right now
I pray for peace. I pray for joy. I pray for confidence. I pray for reassurance
I thank you so much for the person listening to this right now
I pray that You would bless them
Bless their mind, bless their finances
Bless their family, bless their sons, bless their daughters, bless their moms, bless their dads, bless their grandparents
God, I just pray for an overwhelming sense of Your presence in their home right now
An overwhelming sense of Your peace that says, Everything is going to be all right.

We reject what we dont understand
We turn our backs on a fellow man
I wanna change, but my heart is bleedin
Heart is hard, and cant nobody see me
I wanna be there for the ones that need me
I cant stand the pain I see on TV
Jealous cause they wanna be me
Damn it man, this life aint easy
It takes over me
My unforgiveness keeps control of me
Damnit, I gotta get a hold of me
Gotta get a hold of me, oh
What you want out of life? Thats the question
This aint a simulation, its a blessing
Is it a mistake or is it destined?
We aint got no time for second guessin
We cant save ourselves, we need a savior
We aint make ourselves, we need a maker
I keep failin myself, I need somethin new
So I lay my life down, I give it all to You
All to You, give it all to You 
Give it all to You, give it all 
Oh, oh
I came to the end of me, believin the enemy
Comin with that Mmm, man, you aint a friend of me
Nothing can fix that, ooh, not even the Hennessy
I had to switch it up, yeah, switch up the remedy
God, can You use imperfect people? 
Cause Im broken through and through 
Just tell me where I need to go 
Cause thats all that I wanna do 
Im a mess, but Im tryna grow
Im upset, but I still wanna know
Is there more for my life
Or is that all she wrote? 
Uh, is that all she wrote? 
Is that all she wrote? 
Is that all she wrote?
Thanks to all them Judas kisses, I got a masters in forgiveness
I dont need a jail system, I walk in conviction
Id rather pray to God, than pray for wishes
Im supernatural, not superstitious, theres a difference
Like relationship versus religion, thats a prison
Im lightin circle, then royal purple inside a prism
This flow is so universal, it came with dreams and visions
I got the keys to the kingdom, Im bout my Father business
I came up straight from the bottom, I started from the finish
You cant undermine a mastermind
I may be out of your mind, but I aint out of mine
Im co-crucified, bury, resurrected
And perfected in the Son of God
Just like water turn to wine, Im a prophetic sign
Ask your barber, Ima headliner in New York Times

When the day is over
And those thoughts set in
That's when I start to wonder
Where do I fit in?
But then You remind me that You're holding me tight
You say the past is behind me and it'll be alright
And You say to me, it'll be alright
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
When I'm all alone and fear is all I see
Sitting in the silence with these insecurities
Its then You remind me, You're holding me tight
And You love me completely, You're always by my side
And You say to me, it'll be alright
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
I know You're not a God out there hiding on mountains, oh no
You come right where I am, lost my way but You found me
Like a ray in the dark, on my ugliest days
You say that You'll always love me just the same
And then You remind me that You're holding me tight
You said the past is behind me and it will be alright
Oh, and You say to me it'll be alright
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright
It will, it will be alright
I hear those words over and over, "It'll be alright"
Go to sleep, my child, it'll be alright
Sleep soundly, my child, it'll be alright
I'm right here, my child, it'll be alright
I won't go anywhere, it'll be alright
You're in the palm of my hand, it'll be alright
My arms are wrapped around you, it'll be alright
While you sleep, I watch over you, it'll be alright
I'll take care of your loved ones, it'll be alright
Your future's in my hands, it'll be alright
Your past is forgiven, it'll be alright
Your future is secure, it'll be alright
I forgive you, it'll be alright

And I disturb the peace like Luda 
Been droppin low like you be doin on that computer
You want a long distance love, I want computer love 
So drop it low and back it back like a computer does 
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop 
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop 
Ooh, when we both logged on, I didnt wanna turn off
Thats that computer love 
Hit you up on the laptop 
I told you meet me at the last spot
You went with me, fell in love
Didnt take long for you to gain my trust, no
With all that Ive been through, you make it simple
I never thought I would meet an angel
Until I met you, until I met you 
Ima put you on the rocks 
Nobody fuckin with the Wops 
Baby give me all that she got
Share it with me, we gon throw it all in the pot 
This the type of love more than physical 
When a king get a queen, he invincible 
Fought the system every level, it was critical 
Fuck the feds, state, civil, and municipals 
Even then, through computers I was kissin you 
Remember through the computer, I would visit you 
Daydreamin bout us fuckin in your living room 
Doin push ups cause I know you bout to visit soon 
Im from the 6, I grew up in the worst trap 
Im way too rich, bae, to fall for a thirst trap 
Plus I know the grass aint greener on the other side 
Cause my house so big, I rarely see the other side 
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop 
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop 
Ooh, when we both logged on, I didnt wanna turn off
Thats that computer love 
(Computer love, computer love
Computer love, computer love
Computerized, digital love
Computerized
A beautiful love)

Once and for all

Therell never be nobody like You 
Therell never be nobody like You, Jesus 
Why? Why is there nobody like Jesus?
Hasnt billions of men and women lived on this planet?
But why, why are we convinced theres nobody like Jesus?
Was He not merely a teacher, a prophet
An exegeter, an explainer and yet we find ourselves in history wondering
Is there anyone like Jesus?
Who is this Jesus?
This Man from the Middle East who claims to be God
Is He God? Is He sinless? Is He perfection?
Is He the once and for all sacrifice for humanity?
Is He a man without fear?
Did He become sin so that you and I might become right in our relationship with God?
Is there nobody like Jesus?
Did He die between two criminals on the crucifixion?
Three days later, did He rise again as the grave empty?
Has He defeated death, Hell in the grave and sin itself?
If so, there is nobody like Jesus
Its a holiday, yeah
Spend it with you, baby

You know that feeling when you leave your love and its right behind you
Cant believe that you did me wrong, we were on iChat all night long

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Now Im all gone, gone, gone
Im gone
Im afraid to say the wrong thing
Criticized from every angle
And Im afraid to lay it on the line
And selfishly I wanna hold back
Do we got the room to make mistakes?
Are we judged for everything we say? 
I wanna grow but Im afraid 
And will it always be the same? 
Does what I gotta say even matter? 
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
Cause Im really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybodys getting canceled
And cant there be room for maturity?
Cause writing em off is not the answer
Do we got the room to make mistakes? 
Are we judged for everything we say? 
I wanna grow but Im afraid 
And will it always be the same? 
Does what I gotta say even matter? 
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
Cause Im really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybodys getting canceled 
And cant there be room for maturity?
Cause writing em off is not the answer
We cant write people off
God never writes us off
Even in our darkest days, even when we least deserve it
Even when were doing that stupid thing we wish we werent doing
God never writes us off, ever
Hes with us in our pain, Hes with us in our struggle
Hes with us in our bad decisions
Hes with us all the time, He never writes us off 
You formed the whole of me 
Inward and out 
I am awesomely and wonderfully created 
Your creations are spectacular
You skillfully designed me 
You saw the essence of me, before I was formed
Before I existed, all of my days were written in your book
Psalms 139:13-
I just cant wait, yeah
I dont want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need 
And I dont care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I dont need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus wont make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I wont ask for much this Christmas
I wont even wish for snow

Underneath the mistletoe

To the North Pole for Saint Nick

To hear those magic reindeer click
Cause I just want you here tonight
Holdin on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere 
And the sound of children laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa wont you bring me the one I really need?
Wont you please bring my baby to me? Yeah
Oh, I dont want a lot for Christmas
This is all Im asking for
I just wanna see my baby, yeah
Standing right outside my door

So when the lights turn off

There is one question I would ask
Is it cause when we first started, we was movin really fast
It is cause it was blurry and we worried by the past
Well now baby girl, Im starting fresh
Every time I see you like we never met
Better yet, Imma get a jet, we fly to Paris, on the wheel like it was Ferris
Baby girl you who I cherish
Dont get worried about your parents
We gon chill

When I walk up in the room
Girl, You know I see you blush, hush!

Hi, Im Ed Sheeran, in session here and this is my cover... kind of... of Justin Biebers Love Yourself...
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Oh, if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself

With all of my thank yous added up
I still cant thank Birdman enough, I woke up in a new Tyra Banks

Real niggas say rest in peace to DJ Screw
Rest in peace to Pimp C too
Fuck your bulletproof vest I still need proof, my nigga

Cherish every step that we take, some of us clumsy
Lookin for a breath of fresh air, its hidin from me, fuck

Niggas bumpin their gums, I feel like Orajel
Got em scratchin their head, combin out broken nails
See I give em my love, but Im an indian giver
Got my ear to the streets, I hear the enemy whisper
I break the bank with a sledgehammer
Cellphone rings like Saturn
Bitch let a nigga breathe, breathe like a dragon
I hide money everywhere, thats my hidden talent
One time for them gangstas, fuck that, two times for them gangstas
If you got a problem, Ill fix that like, yeah nigga Im maintenance
Got a bad bitch and she anxious, bitch, you just an acquaintance
Ill ask a rat, Why be a rat? then kill him while he explainin
Tell your foot soldiers to walk light, handful of real niggas left
And if any nigga wanna step to me tell em hurry up and take bigger steps

Being alone, alone

Being alone, alone

Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool

Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Jumped in my ride, checkin that nobody saw

Saw it was early morning
Thought wed better be leavin
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didnt mean to break the rules

When I get older
I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom
Just like a waving flag
Born from a throne, older than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone
But its my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, but now its gone
Out of the darkness, in came the carnage
Threatening my very survival
Fractured my streets and broke all my dreams
Now feels like defeat to wretched retreat
So we struggling
Fighting to eat
And we wondering
If well be free
We can not wait for some faithful day
It's too far away so right now I'll say
When I get older, I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
So many wars, settling scores
All that weve been through and now there is more
I hear them say love is the way
Love is the answer thats what they say
But were not just dreamers of broken down grievers
A hand will reach us and will not forsake us
This cant control us, no it can't hold us down
We gon pick it up even though we still struggling
Au nom de la survie
And we wondering
Battant pour nos vie
We patiently wait for some other day
Thats too far away so right now I say
When I get older, I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
How come when the media stops covering
And there's a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling
And assume that its really all love again, nah
See we don't have to wait for things to break apart
If you werent involved before, it's never too late to start
You probably think that it's too far to even have to care
Well, take a look at where you live, what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again
When I get older, I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
Then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
Theyll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
When I get older, when I get older
I will be stronger, just like a waving flag
Mafia

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend, when shes around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you? Or were you not aware?
Well youre the smile on my face and I aint going nowhere
Im here to make you happy, Im here to see you smile
But Ive been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Whos gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you cant fly unless you let you, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall
Well I can tell youre afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you dont wanna lose
Well I dont want to lose it either
But I dont think I can stay sitting around while youre hurting babe, so take my hand
Well did you know youre an angel who forgot how to fly?
Well did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of yous gone every time he done wrong, Im the shoulder youre crying on
And I hope by the time that Im done with this song Ill have figured out
Whos gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you cant fly unless you let you, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you cant fly unless you let you, you cant fly unless you let yourself
Fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you cant fly unless you let you, let yourself fall, oh baby

A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times, had a couple conversations
Since youve been on my mind, had a couple observations
Like you a fly chick, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give
Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I dont want to see you tweet about JB cause
The only people that should know is you and me so
Baby I know that youre cool with rocking with me

When I was just a baby
My mama told me, Son
Always be a baby
Dont ever be a gun
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
I hang my head and cry
When I was just a baby
When I was just a boy
I shot a man in Reno
I was just a baby boy
I hear the train a comin
I hear that railroad train
Its probably a good train
My mama was a train
But Im stuck in baby prison
I know I cant be free
I hang my head and pee
When I was just a baby
When I was just a train
I shot a train
But that train was just a car
Im probably drinkin coffee
Just a baby drinking coffee
Always drinking coffee
And smoking big cigars
Well if they freed me from this prison
Well if I was a car
I bet Id be a good car
And thats what tortures me
When I was just a baby
When I was just a boy
My mama shot a man in Reno
I was just a baby boy
When I was just a baby
When I was just a train
I shit my pants
I was just a baby boy
JB, Jaden Smith, lets go
A tornado flew around my room before you came

Thats why you in my arms, just for the day
Cause less than months go by, you be dancing away
But lets just have some fun girl, as long as youre here
Cause when you get up on that plane, youll be gone for a year
And when you come up in my room Ill be bawling some tears
But people say just live in the moment, its wrong to be scared
Girl is it wrong to be scared? Cause thats what they say
And everyday that I dont see you, you slipping away
And all the teachers in my class thinking Im crazy

Anywhere you wanna go, its your choice
Every time that Im away, girl I miss your voice
And I promise that Im nothing like them other boys

Tell you I love you every day and thatll never stop
They say its true love, well is love true?
Yeah I think its love, thats why I found you
And not a second that goes by that I dont think you are so fly
And I know why aint no guy gon treat you like I

You know I know you right, lets go into the night
Thinking bout you, oh no no no
Ive been thinking bout you, oh no no no

Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Do you not think so far ahead?

You think Im crying on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want everyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
But I been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and fuck yourself
And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And when you tried to tell me my opinion was wrong
Then tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want everyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Baby you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong

Oh baby you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and fuck yourself

Everybodys laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading bout this other guy

Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?

That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong
I cant go on til you believe that that should be me
That should be me
You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
Its funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldnt see you out at the movies?
What you doing to me?
Youre taking him where we used to go
Now if youre tryna break my heart, its working cause you know that...

Sere quien rescate tus ganas de amar
I won't let go
Toma mi mano, no me sueltes
Que yo nunca a ti te voy a fallar
I'll be your lifeline tonight
Sere quien rescate tus ganas de amar
Cuando te sientas sola
Sere tu compania
Me volvere tu abrigo
En tus noches oscuras, frias
Respira, solo es un mal dia
Ni cayendo te soltaria
Y si me pierdo en el amor
En tu corazon me encontraria
En agua fria
Saltando a lo ciego por el amor
Y lo repetiria aun siendo un error
En agua fria
Saltando a lo ciego por el amor
Y lo repetiria aun siendo un error
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
Sere quien rescate tus ganas de amar
I won't let go
Toma mi mano, no me sueltes
Que yo nunca a ti te voy a fallar
I'll be your lifeline tonight
Sere quien rescate tus ganas de amar
Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
Im all alone
And I hope, I hope someone's gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know
I won't let go
Toma mi mano, no me sueltes
Que yo nunca a ti te voy a fallar
I'll be your lifeline tonight
Sere quien rescate tus ganas de amar
I won't let go
Toma mi mano, no me sueltes
Que yo nunca a ti te voy a fallar

Subjected to my system, reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interests, our trust was in our bank
Thats where our hearts once stay
Then we got closer
Separated from my ex til we had closure
Ooh, every passing, feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands, my love is here to stay
So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There in the moment I wont need your grace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to me holding you, used to me warming you, oh get used to it
And now my achor wont shower you, forever and for me
Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworks be a fourth of July for life
As long as you stand right by my side
Keep growing closer throughout October
Ooh counting down, its almost Christmas eve
Ooh seven days shy of New Years eve
Then well be celebrating
So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There in the moment I wont need your grace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you

And for some reason I just 
And Im stronger than this 
No more walking round
With my head down
Im so over being blue
Crying over you
And Im so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why cant I turn off the radio?
Gotta fix that calendar I have
Thats marked July 15th
Because since theres no more you
Theres no more anniversary
Im so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
Thats the reason
And Im so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said Im so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why cant I turn off the radio?
Leave me alone
Dont make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
Im letting go
Turning off the radio
Yeah yeah
You asked me to come over 
You said that you would be alone 
And when I got there for you
Someone was in your room
You gotta play these games with me
And all I could do is slam the door
Cant stand you anymore

You know exactly what to do to hurt me 
Its working

She danced the night that they fell out
She swore shed dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own 
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Su-sustaining will last a test of trial
This burning will only last a while
First degree burns dont leave scars
We can turn this plane around

Your heart was spilling over without an end 
I hurt you once before I hurt you again 
You lost the faith that you had , had trusted in

No sadness this summer
Our house was madness this summer
Friends on the Xannies this summer
Had to chill on the drugs cause my albums not done yet
You give boys the longest bone, thats the femur
Ha, biology joke for them nerds in the cafeteria
With no friends at the table, ignoring the pack of mean girls
The jackals, hyenas; the Gretchen Weiners, Karens, Reginas
Im Justin Bieber, crash my Lamborghina, damn you, Selena
Where are you now that I need ya?
Your phone buzz, havent you seen it?
Im Messi like Argentina, love Mary, no Cameron Diaz
I hate having to think Im a smoker & Im a drinker, uh-uh
Stars in the sky, stars in your mind
Dreams we had with no money, sculling our wine
Neither of us have had one at a time
Till we left our phones dead and our past behind
Can you put me on to that new?
A throwback would go down too
Maybe this could be one of our tunes

Pick me, pick me up, wrap me up
Wrap on some sunnies, carry me up beach, holiday with me
I just need somebody
Will you ever know?
That second album though
I hope you got the inspo you needed
I know its hard, that first love, you cant repeat it
Oh, to beat it, itd be a feat, complete 180
Will we ever know it?
Will we ever know?
Bet it would feel like oooooh
Bet it would feel like oooooh
You worked two jobs
To keep a roof above our heads
You chose
A life for me, no you never gave up
I admire you, for the strength you've instilled in me
You were so young
You were just my age when you had me mom
You were so brave
There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me
So when you're lost and you're tired
When you're broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I, I still turn to you
I still turn to you, I still turn to you
It was '94
The year that everything started to change
From before
You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways
Then you found the Lord
You gave your life to Him, and you could not ignore the love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heart
So when you're lost and you're tired
When you're broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I, I still turn to you
I don't know what I'd if you left me
Everything that you are is who I am
Who I am today
So when you're lost and you're tired
When you're broken in two

Looking out the window, waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway, its really comin down tonight
Youre scared that I wont make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm
Ill be waiting under the mistletoe
While youre drivin here, through the winter snow
Baby, think of me
If it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby, think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas
Pacing down the hallway, tryna fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop, except for the clock on the wall yeah, yeah
And Im scared that you wont make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm
Ill be waiting under the mistletoe
While youre driving here, through the winter snow
Baby, think of me
If it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby, think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas
Im praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
You and I til Christmas morning
Theres nothing else that I want this year 
More than just to have you here, Ill be waiting
Ill be waiting under the mistletoe
While youre driving here, through the winter snow
Baby, think of me
If it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby, think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas
Looking out the window waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway, its really coming down tonight

I guess they want a reaction
But I aint gonna give it to em
Yeah they tryna get at me yeah but I aint gonna feed into it
Ooh they been persistent tryna break me down
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
They can't take what's mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Ooh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping
Hoping you would change me, hoping you would make me lose my mind)
Way too strong for that, you know you were wrong for that
So keep on chasing that 458 as I cruise on the smooth highway
I aint even tryna get away, Im good, they try to break me
Hoping and praying I really wont make it, all of these dreams, they tried to forsake me
How you gon play me? How you gon break me? Ive been in this ish since diapers and babies
All my life, been driving them crazy, there go the Blakey, thought of them ladies
Dreaming of Benz, and kissing Mercedes, living the life, the life is so crazy
I need some cameras, hundreds and ladies, how you expect me not to go crazy?
Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends, the monies still gravy
We the new stars, thats why they still hating, money up front, we never be waiting
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient
Its a cold world we that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant
They wish Satan tellers was in itthen theyd prey for me to be finished
Them haters gon start tripping when you dont pay them no attention
And the obstacle I might face, I guarantee that I kill it
No sleep at all, runnin a lie
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time
Thats a , thats a double negative, oh
Showing up late, dragging along
Wont pick up the phone while I be gone
Cant deny it
Its a double negative
Oh, double negative
Another jet, another day in the sky
Fly in another direction from you
Wish I could FedEx my heart
And show up to your door
Signed, sealed, delivered
But I make you cry, let you down
More than likely from across town
Double shame on me
Double shame, oh
No sleep at all, runnin a lie
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time
Thats a , thats a double negative, oh
Showing up late, dragging along
Wont pick up the phone while I be gone
Cant deny it
Its a double negative
Oh, double negative

And he aint got no patience
Shes like, He never got nothing planned
So hell never get anxious
Look in your mind
Keep wondering if youre too high maintenance
Look in your mind
Keep wondering if Im just too famous 
Tryna shake the negative energy
Im with the karma coming right back on me
In a moment Im flying
Metaphorically, it seems like Heaven
No sleep at all, runnin a lie 
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time 
Thats a , thats a double negative, oh
Showing up late, dragging along 
Wont pick up the phone while I be gone
Cant deny it 
Its a double negative 
Oh, yeah yeah
Oh, double negative 
Never miss the negativity
Oh no, no
Oh, woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, yeah
Everybody gets lost sometimes, you know?
Thats how we learn and how we grow
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldnt be drowning on your own
 
You go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, its been a heck of a ride driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
 
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
 
I used to believe
That we were burnin on the edge of somethin beautiful
Somethin beautiful
Selling a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin on a miracle
On a miracle
 
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us to different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know, I wont let go
 
Dont you give up, nah-nah-nah
I wont give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you

And I hope, I hope someone's gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul

Someday at Christmas therell be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what lifes really worth
Therell be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas well see a man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas therell be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time, someday at Christmas time

Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released
Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that theres always tomorrow
Lean on me, when youre not strong 
And Ill be your friend
Ill help you carry on 
For it wont be long
Til Im gonna need 
Somebody to lean on
Please swallow your pride
If I have things that you need to borrow
For no one can fill
Those of your needs
That you wont let show
You just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that youll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me, when youre not strong
And Ill be your friend 
Ill help you carry on 
For, for it wont be long
Til Im gonna need
Somebody to lean on
You just call on me brother 
When you need a hand 
We all need somebody to lean on
On a tous les memes problemes Pour qu'on se comprenne
We all need somebody to lean on 
If there is a load you have to bear
That you cant carry
Im right up the road
Ill share your load
If you just call me
 If you need a friend

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, yeah
If you don't train, you never know what's next to come
If you can't see the top, then you can't be number one, number one
Go spread your wings just like an eagle and fly
Oh don't you look back after you conquer the sky
Never wanna run away, never let your work be in vain
When you see the finish line is in your face
Have no pain, no pain
When love is all you have to give
You gotta let it persevere through the pain, any pain
Let your light shine through
Don't let none get in your way
No pain , no pain 
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah
No pain, fearless, oh no pain
Oh woah, oh woah, no pain
When I was young I used to sing out on the block
No one came in your space, I had to make my own spot, aye
Staying determined, wasn't easy at times
Never stopping your focus, till all fell in line
Never did I run away, never let my work be in vain
When the finish line was in my face
Have no pain, no pain
When love is all you have to give
You gotta let it persevere through the pain, any pain
Let your light shine through
Don't let none get in your way
No pain , no pain 
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah
No pain, fearless, oh no pain
Oh woah, oh woah, no pain
Im at a party I dont wanna be at
And I dont ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin if I could sneak out the back
Nobodys even lookin me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, Shall we dance? Oh yeah
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Dont think I fit in at this party
Everyones got so much to say 
I always feel like Im nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
Cause I dont care when Im with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And youre making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Cause I dont care long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And youre making me feel like Im loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We at a party we dont wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we cant hear ourselves
Move your lips, Id rather say it right back
With all these people all around
Im crippled with anxiety
But Im told its where Im sposed to be
You know what? Its kinda crazy cause I really dont mind
When you make it better like that
Dont think we fit in at this party
Everyones got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said Im sorry
But now I think that we should stay
Cause I dont care when Im with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And youre making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Cause I dont care long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And youre making me feel like Im loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when Im with my baby, yeah

I told you Id change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I cant find nobody else as good as you

Mielismy kwit, ale w oczy nam huragany
Bez rozy wiatrow ciezko byloby sie ruszyc z miejsca
Wychowywany w domu rozbitym jak fura Diany
Nauczylem sie tam, ze synergia jest najwazniejsza
Pogladem odchodze od tego, co przechodzilem
Dla kontrastu sporo akcji na lewo w rynek
Przyzwyczailem sie ze beda co godzine dzwonic
Ze jak nie nawine, no to ktos tu ukradnie mi pomysl
Paru ludzi przez to nie ma, jest wiecej przestrzeni
Nawet Archimedes wtedy by nas nie podzielil
Bujalem sie wsrod marzycieli; wiekszosc nadal ze mna
Kazdy w trybie przelicz, kazdy z gorsza miesieczna
On zawsze dobra mina do zlej gry jak Joker
Albo kazdy z tych bardziej socjalnych
To zadne sny z boiska, postalem z rok pod blokiem
Ale stworzylem wizje po to by je urealnic
Nigdy zadnego cpania tu, a jak Schizoidzi
Chcesz to plyn, dla mnie to troche jak mania
Pewnie bym kochal to, gdybym tego nie nienawidzil
Stracilem przez to ziomka; szkoda mi zdrowia i siana
Zimny Cristal w cieplym domu, jutro to freestyle
Perly? - chyba odszukasz tylko na dnie!
Dzisiaj czuje sie jak racjonalista
Mogacy miec wszystko, czego dusza zapragnie
Cant make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Please dont waste my time, time, time, time, time
Im not tryin to rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Oohhhh
Mam cale zycie spakowane w jeden plik
To ma drugi biegun, za trudny rebus jak smiech przez lzy
Za duzo dobrych checi, przez to przechodze przez pieklo
Wymaze z pamieci, jakbym walczyl o role w "Memento"
To, gdzie jestem, nadal robi mi z glowy destroy
Jestem konfliktowy, jak sie pogodzic z mysla?
Ze najtrwalsze wspomnienie, wszystko, co spisze
I tak zniknie z wizji jak teleturnieje z Ibiszem
Dla tego plyne pod prad jak Gunjack
I bedzie tak, poki nie wezma mnie do unplugged
Zycie jak zart, emocje sa prawie martwe
Idac w strone morza, nadal czuje sie jak Javier Bardem
Jestem na wpol niewidomy od dziecka
I tylko slucham, jak szklane domy tluka sie o twarde serca
Slepo wierzac, ze swiat ma dla mnie barwe szczescia
Slepo wierzac?
Swiat ma dla mnie barwe szczescia
Mam grubsza rozkmine niz to, co nawine
Wokol tyle zla, ze nawet nie chce mi sie moczyc tych soczewek w plynie
Skurwysynie, mialem je dlugo przed Hopsinem
Dzis nosze w sobie tylko wine, tylko wine
Ktora zzera pustka, nie nabieram wody w usta
Jestem MC, akronimem od mea culpa
Nie zgadniesz... I bede sie smial dopoki nie padne
Bezsens, niech kazdy nosi swe ciernie
Nie reaguje na krzyk, wstyd mi nie jest za to, kim jestem
Jestes z nami - na nic ci strach, jak panicz bawic sie czas
Chowaj rady - mamy ich nad to, nie dla slabych kraina ta
Cant make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Please dont waste my time, time, time, time, time
Im not tryin to rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova
Oohhhh
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud
Well, hey there shawty with the big, brown eyes
I know you got something that I really do like
If you rock with me, I can make you mine tonight, tonight
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isnt me
Im waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
Asking what I do isnt any of your business
Looking at my crew like youre something you fit in with
I dont even know if you thinking what Im thinking
But Im thinking bout your body, would you lay down for a minute?
Well, hey there shawty with the big, brown eyes
I know you got something that I really do like
If you rock with me, I can make you mine tonight, tonight
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isnt me
Im waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isnt me
Im waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
Is there an essence to the problem
If you ask me, I can solve them
If you need me, then I need you
And theres more than I can take than this love could be
More than amazement, more than entertainment
And if you need me 
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isnt me
Im waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isnt me
Im waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
Dont fall asleep
At the wheel, weve got a million miles ahead of us
Oh ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know were good enough
Oh good enough
Say go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
And its been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Baby, I just dont get it, do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You dont believe his stories, you know that theyre all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just dont know why
If I was ya man, baby, youd
Never worry bout, what I do
Id be coming home, coming back to you
Every night, doing you right
Youre the type of woman, who deserves good things
Fistful of diamonds, hand full of rings
Baby, youre a star, I just want to show you you are
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way loves supposed to be
Let me love you, nah nah nah
Let me love you
Let me love you, nah nah nah
You should let me love love love you
Someone to hold it down

Girl, I wish you would, would, yeah
Whats the use in calling me?
If you aint gon be out the way with it
With my feelings I have plans to use one day, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Whats the use in calling you?

So we can understand each other and never ever fight
Oh I dont wanna fight
Cause I got room in my life

Running everywhere trying to find who I am
Going nowhere so Im trying again
I am so lost like paper no pen
Yes you have call so, yes, here I am
Cold no sweater
Bold no letter
So much better
My role go-getter
My tole is red then the fire in my eyes
Imma rain no weather
The goal Imma set is a whole lot better
When the storm from Jehovah comes
Im gonna be the best ever
Love from the start
Peace in my heart
Imma roll ah were never be apart
But I still wonder
Have I felt the thunder?
I can feel it in my heart shooting like a like a hunter
Yeah, a straight gunner, but it feels strange
Yeah the things in my heart, makes things change
How I felt before makes my brain rearrange
And what I do it for is definitely not the same
Can I just take a minute?
Yeah, just wait a minute
Starting to hate the minute
We have to pay the minute
Yah alright ok the minute
Or we could wait a minute
See how many times it just takes to say a minute
Life is so short, but we just take it for granted
Hand over my life and it was a life I was handed
Flying so high and, yes, I just landed
Im tryna figure out what my plan is
His hand is on my life, and my sin just vanished
My filth washes of quick like her fake tan is
Im growing up quick like a grown man is
Imma be set so will my great grand kids
Swag!!!!!
Lately Ive been really stressed out I have done many dumb things
Like leavin a show cos someone in the front row spilled a drink
And walking round naked while photographers, snapped pics of my peen
Then claiming I was a victim of shrinkage
My manager told me to make a song to apologize
He told me to act like my life is hard so people empathize
Then he said to look at the camera and make sad puppy dog eyes
Cos it would make my teen girl fans feel bad for me
Yeah, when I publicly say Im sorry
Everyone will instantly forgive me
And once they do that
I can get away with anything
So once Ive said Im sorry, I did bad
I can go back to being a douchebag
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
I can act like a total piece of shit
As long as I say Im sorry for it
I could seduce a hot mom and talk her into intercourse
Tell her to leave her husband for me and cause her to get divorced
Then when I bail it's ok as long as I express remorse
I've forgiven for ruining her family
Eh...
I could punch a bum in the tummy
And
I could eat your food if it's yummy
Wow these fries are good
I could even kick someone's baby
As long as I pretend I feel regret
I could beat an old man with a baguette
I'm sorry...
Yeah...
Sorry...
Yeah...
Sorry...
I just saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens
Now I'll tweet out spoilers of how it ends
Oh... wait! Hold on... I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry, don't do it. No!
I'm sorry...
Yeah...
Sorry...
Yeah...
Sorry...
Hey I said sorry Kylo what the fuck?
Now put my head back on you stupid schmuck!
Lyrics from Snippet
...away, huh

But Ima be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you

Chestnuts roasting like a hot July

Figured out how to mean what I say
I just gotta be me...
Open your mind

If I was wrong then you was wrong too, youre the one I'm holding on to
Youre the one that broke the code that was on the phone and started scrolling through
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?
First off this started when you broke in my phone 
And I know how you like to blame me for everything
Girl, but you were wrong 
But do it really matter though?
I feel like me and you girl, we had it all
Im wishing on a star
Girl, tell me where you are or how you been
Gotta tell you now, we may never speak again
Baby when you're wrong I gotta let you know that youre wrong
You know you should of never went upstairs and broke into my phone
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?
You want me to love you, but how much do you love me?
If I was wrong then you was wrong too, youre the one Im holding on to
Youre the one that broke the code that was on the phone and started scrolling through
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?
Girl I miss the days when it was just you and me
Me and you going through the storm, baby tell me do you still believe
Or is it all gone?
I feel like me and you girl, we had it all
Im wishing on a star
Girl, tell me where you are or how you been
Gotta tell you now, we may never speak again
Baby when youre wrong I gotta let you know that youre wrong
You know you should of never went upstairs and broke into my phone
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?
You want me to love you, but how much do you love me?
If I was wrong then you was wrong too, you're the one I'm holding on to
Youre the one that broke the code that was on the phone and started scrolling through
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?
Hold on
Bet you didn't think I knew that code huh, no
Bet you didnt think Id go upstairs and call that girl huh, no
Bet you didnt think I threw your phone into that door huh, no
I expected you to have something there but not them photos

If I was wrong then you was wrong too, youre the one Im holding on to

You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I dont do too well with apologies
I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry? Oh
Cause Im needing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry? Oh
Cause I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say
Im sorry, baby
Yeah Im sorry, sorry
Sorry
Ill take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
Ill go, Ill go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry? Oh
Cause Im needing more than just your body, baby
Is it too late now to say sorry? Oh
Cause I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say
Im sorry, baby
Sorry, oh
Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, And Ill be there
You are my love, You are my heart

Rest assured Imma be your guardian protecting you
Thick or thin, Imma be parallel right next to you
Through winter, spring, summer time, Ill fall with you
Take my hand, well bring each other up together now
Cant believe God blessed me with an angel just like you
See my arms, were made to wrap around you
My heart, was made to beat for you
This love was made to adore you in every way
All of my time is made to spend on you
Life, gotta live for you
Wanna post it on a billboard till you know the world is yours
Thats for sure
Rest assured Imma be your guardian protecting you
Thick or thin, Imma be parallel right next to you
Through winter, spring, summer time, Ill fall with you
Take my hand, well bring each other up together now
Cant believe God blessed me with an angel just like you
Its like every time you fall
No ones gonna lend you a helping hand, oh
Wondering will you spend your life facing four walls
Like standing in quicksand, oh
Dont let your guard down, hold your head up
Life comes at you fast, gotta stay strong
I know what you can be cause underneath
Youve had wings all along
And youve been travelling the same road for a long time
Feels like youre burning rubber going nowhere fast
I mean to tell you theres no limit to what you can do
You just gotta believe
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla
I think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me
Girl it's getting late, the suns going down
And it's about time I shake my way across the town
But before I go I just want to say
That you stay on my mind each and every day
I think Im starting to like the time that we spent
And when it's building inside, then I can't pretend
No I don't want to fight it, I don't want to hide the way I feel
So I guess it's time for me to say
That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better
Cause on nights like this
It's good to know that youve got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say, hope this will last forever
Don't know if its love, its too early to say
But if it's something like it, I just want it to remain
Don't know if you're the one that takes a little time
But in the meantime girl, you feeling just fine
Cause the way you look at me never seen that look before
And if it's a hint of what's to come then baby can I get some more
Not tryna be too forward
But I think it's best for you to know
That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better
Cause on nights like this
It's good to know that youve got someone by your side like this

I be tryna chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the Force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood, swish
I gotta be the best, and yes, were the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moons where I land, Im gone
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never, never say never 
Never say never and never say never 
Never say never, never say never 
And never say never
Never say never and never say never 
Never say never and never say never 
Never say never and never say never
And never say never

I never thought that itd be easy cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us and were wondering how
No one has a solid answer, but just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you and its up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Ooh, woah, ooh
And mama you were always somewhere, and daddy I live out of town
So tell how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best, so tell me why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away, and now I just need you here
So well fight through the hurt
And well cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you and its up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Ooh, woah, ooh
We fell so far away from where we used to be
And now were standing and where do we go?
When theres no road to get to your heart
Lets start over again
So its up to you and its up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
I never thought that itd be easy
Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And were wondering how
Whats the use of being lonely when Im offering my company?
You could be my lover, hold me, Ill give you attention all night, all day
Intertwine, we can intertwine
We can intertwine, we can intertwine, oh yeah
Had the whole hood shook when you moved in
Face like a goddess, body on ten
Had to be back in the crib before the streets lights
That was back when you wasnt allowed to have friends
Now you grown up, features all swole up
Seen you at the club had me like Hol up
What you doing, who you with, what you sipping on?
Who you doing, where you been? Let me take you home
And if you hungry we can stop at the Waffle House

Take that time to get to know me
Cause baby whats the use of being lonely?
Whats the use of being lonely when Im offering my company?
You could be my lover, hold me, Ill give you attention all night, all day
Intertwine, we can intertwine
We should make some time, so I can intertwine with you
We can intertwine, just let me get behind
And watch me run up in that thang like the finish line
To end it like its Christmas time, I eat it like its dinner time
She said lets do it like at 86, I said lets do it like 69
Give her a bit a this it aint no way she getting tired
Introduced to the molly now shes ampd and shes wired
Get her back to the room, she said Twizzy is who I desire
I said lets get in the shower girl that ass is on fire
I pay you with attention, direct deposit wire
That shit dont need even matter as long as love transpires
And after all that, baby you should really know me
Now you aint got never be lonely
Tell me do you really want it? Wake up in the morning
Right next to me baby, right next to me baby
Tell me do you really want it? Wake up in the morning
Right next to me baby, right next to me baby
This is the time a year we can give it, give it, give it, give it all

Make your wish tonight when you open your eyes
When the lights go bright, girl, Ill be right there
Baby, you deserve everything you want, its your night, oh
Wanna put my ear to your chest, girl

Baby, it sings to me, like fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me, like now I know that its Christmas time
You got on my favourite dress
Youre looking, looking, looking good
Snow fallin on your hair, and I dont, I dont wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky cant outshine your eyes
I wanna be your biggest gift, whoa
Baby, you deserve everything you want
Its your night, oh
Wanna put my ear to your chest now
Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me, like fa la la la la, fa la la la la

Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ahh, yeah
What? Wait
But yesterday we were
I dont understand
We started out it was perfect, nothing but fun
And my heart was convinced to say that youre the one
And I thought it would last for the rest of our lives
Boy was I in for a big surprise
With no doubt looking round, thinking that Im so cool
Same place, same time every day of my life, could we meet after school?
Finally if I didnt make her cry
She wouldnt be with another guy
Nothing can cure my headache
Cause Im experiencing what they call heartbreak
It's gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I cant shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say its only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here
Now Im all tore up taking back when I was at your door
The first time when you said, Forever Ill be yours
Started walking, your hand in my hand, feelings got stronger
We made a promise
And whenever I leave, it feels like youre still with me
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I got to get out of here
What am I to do when I look up and you're not there, woah?
Say Im too young for love
I got so much life to live ahead
But, if only this is love I could get over
I know I have to deal with the pain
When I see you, you dont think I run up on you 
No way
And I dont want a text when I flex on you 
Get it, mic check, one, two 
Get it, mic check, one, two 
Baby in my life, one, two
Baby in my life, one, two, yeah
So break it down, break it down, down
Break it down like Ooh-ooh
Break it down, break it down, down
Break it down like Ooh-ooh
Oh, break it down, break it down, down
Break it down like Ooh-ooh
Oh, break it down, break it down, down
Break it down like Ooh-ooh
I can admit it, I wanna get it down
I can admit it, just wanna hit it now
Can we defeat it, can we debate it now
I gotta let it, baby, it's litty now
Oh, when it come down to it
When it comes down to it
When it comes down to it
When it comes down to it, I know that

When it, when it all come, when it all comes down to it

When it all comes down to it, I know
When I found out, down to it
When I come right down to it
When it comes right down it
When it, when it comes right down to it
When it comes right down to it
And I found time for it, when I come right down to it
Oh, no-no
They've all been a lie
When I get in, hit it right
She a ten, wont hit it right
She dont wont think I come when I need it right
Bang-bang-bang, what you dont doubt
Bang-bang-bang, think its goin down
If it thang thang, think its going down
If it come down, think its going down
Wait, oh, down, break it down, down
Break it down, break it down, down, down
Oh, break it down, break it down, down
Break it down, break it down, down, down
Oh, break it down, break it down, down

Every time that you come down
Lead in, it can fall now
Back and forth, swang, oh yah
Same-same like Oh yeah
Chain swang like Oh nah
Have me dancing like no-now
When it come through the soul now
T.O banging like door down
When it comes down 
When I come like 
 dont shake it all down
When in all now 
Oh damn, Im coming in, save that
I hear a lot about sinners
Dont think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, its making me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I dont do well with the drama
And, no, I cant stand it being fake
I dont believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I cant explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy 
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say were too young and
The pimps and the players say, Don't go crushin
Wise men say fools rush in
But I dont know 
They say were too young and
The pimps and the players say, Don't go crushin
Wise men say fools rush in
But I dont know
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
Im a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they dont see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Lets take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, brides groom, Im my fathers child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Fathers proud
If you make it to the water, Hell part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust
I know I aint leavin you like I know He aint leavin us
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
 Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think it should be something
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to something
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And everytime you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think it should be something
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to something
You should go and love yourself
Good days, better nights
No stress, no fights
Cold drinks, city lights
This is what I used to call the good life
Hah, and now I tell myself
Staring at my cell phone just wont help
Keeping all the clothes on my top left shelf
Is only gonna keep me in this hell, oh well
So wow, stumble at the hotel lobby
Looking for a cab to the afterparty
Tryna fit five girls in the back
The only thing on my mind is where the hell you at
Are you with your new man?
Fuck, drink drink
Are you making new plans?
Fuck, drink drink
Bottles til I cant stand, cant think, think
I cant think, cant think
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer til our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Because you know Im all about that bass, bout that bass, no treble
Im all about that bass, bout that bass, no treble
Im all about that bass, bout that bass, no treble

You and I, both know it cant work
Its all fun and games
Til someone gets hurt
And I dont, I wont let that be you
Now you dont wanna let go
And I dont wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we dont wanna fall but
Were tripping in our hearts
And its reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you cant love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
Im still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I dont care, I got you baby
See we both
Fighting every inch of our fibers
Cause aint no way its gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop
Now you dont wanna let go
And I dont wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we dont wanna fall but
Were tripping in our hearts
And its reckless and clumsy
And I know you cant love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
But fight with time and space cause
Im still stuck in the moment with you
See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we cant be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree and I aint with it
And I dont wanna be so old and gray, reminiscing bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go, so well never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place, oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do, nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space and space
Cause Im still stuck in the moment with you

MSFTS
You are a g bro
You're a wrap

Swaggy, swaggy, swaggy, swaggy
Oh, I ain't never met a groupie
All I meet is ladies
And I like my privacy
So I got a Mercedes
Got these chokers shaking
Reminding me have hated
Sorry 'bout the security
It's only for your safety
Cause baby I'll be pimpin'
Holler if you see me
I'm probably in Miami
With my girl in a bikini
Text me if you need me
Touch me if you're greedy
'Cause you'll probably be with Nicki
Walking while she says Waikiki
How we the illest and the youngest?
I really don't know how we the killest and the dumbest
Swear it's really early
But I don't know where the sun is
And girl just take my hand
While I knock away these hundreds
Cause the crowd is going crazy
Money coming in bundles
Sorry that I couldn't see you
It's hard to see through my stunners
Dumb blondes be sayin' I'm the funnest
All I'm hearing is claps
Though I don't know where the drum is
Girl you like it
So just give me the mic
And I'll get you so excited
Tell me what you want
I'll go home and write it
To a old school beat
Baby take your lip and bite it
Oh jeez
Girl you got me and you gon' make me work
Cause it's usually a hobby
And no I really like you
And no it's not your body
But trust me that's a plus
Cause you're hotter than wasabi
And I'm diggin' on your kicks
Jokers talking 'bout karate
When I want a girl I just whip out the Maserati
No I can't drive it
It's only for the show
And I like to wear them diamonds
Watch them circus glow
Girl I'm on like a light bulb
Are you coming home from the night club?
'Cause I tried to get in but I ain't reached the height limit
That might be over but the night isn't so I'm
So text me if you tryna chill with Wesley
Cause me and Mandy are chillin'
So don't wear nothing dressy
Inside jokes are only funny when you get them
So is the place to be and I'm living in them dance halls
Alright J I think I got it from here
Justin Bieber
Headphones on yeah
Turn them up a little bit
Baby I'm the man
I felt that you knew that
I'm out in Japan
Just because I do that
So baby don't you stop it
Baby can you drop it
I give you my chain
I style like Kentucky
Money on my mind
And you on my mind
Too much on my mind
Too big for my time
And everybody know that
Baby I'm the man
Can't you understand
Keep you wondering
If I'm the wonderman
And you're in wonderland
Hey my name is JB
I'm always rocking Vans
And if I was your boyfriend
I would love you till the end
I'd kiss your face in public
You can tell all of your friends
Baby girl you got that body
Would you like to go to France?
We can fly there on my jet babe
I can give you jetlag
I don't do Jamaica baby
I can make you sweat babe
And if you ain't in the crew
You'll never get this
Posted at the crib with the MSFTS
I used to believe
We were burnin on the edge of somethin beautiful 
Somethin beautiful 
Sellin a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin on a miracle 
On a miracle 
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, its been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you, let me love you
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah

Rush to a plane to find its been delayed
Guess Ill hurry up and wait
Stuck in the sands, still looking for an ocean
Rain on my face, but aint no cloud today
Down on my knees to pray, it turns to hoping
So desperate in the worst way
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I'll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I'll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Wish time wasnt on my side
Oh, guess I'll hurry up and wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

And I didnt wanna write a song cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin on and I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin on and I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that youve made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much

I got breasts music
Another one
You need salad!
Whos the laziest so-called producer with man tits that
Weighs a ton?
Khaleds the one
Only thing hes good at is stupid catchphrases like
Another one, yeah
Wheres the bun, man?
Who doesnt rap, sing, or make beats because hes useless?
Whos only talent is stealing finished music
And then shouting and taking credit?
DJ Khaled 
Hes the one, yeah
Got famous from his Snapchats, being dumb
Drops N bombs, but hes not black, his IQ is 1
Ya, ya
Quavo! Im the only guy in Migos 
That anyone in the world knows 
Im only on this because Future said no 
So did Travis Scott, Gucci Mane, and Mike Jones 
Its obvious that Khaled is a fame slut 
Without JB on this, it wouldve made 10 bucks 
He look like if Drake got inflated with a pump 
He causes earthquakes when he jumps
Whos the most nonsensical, annoying man on Earth?
Khaleds the one, yeah
Another one
When he dances, he looks like an overweight bird
Khaleds the one 
Another one, damn
His entire life is a giant product placement
This video is just a blatant ad for vape pens
He Snapchatted his girl giving birth 
DJ Khaled
Hes a living, breathing meme 
Sir, you need to stop eating 
Okay, though
Ooh!
I dont know why I did this mainstream song
Isnt my image supposed to be underground, and raw?
This beats so poppy, it couldve been used by Elton John
Oh, no, here comes Waynes verse, he sounds like an auto-tuned frog
God forgive me
For doing another Khaled record
This like my 42nd, and it is really depressing
For the record, I rap bout the same dumb stuff on every record
And look like if a gremlin and Whoopi Goldberg gave childbirth
Oh, god
Were sick and tired of you getting so filthy rich from
Our talent 
Were the only reason why the songs such a big hit, youve
Done jack shit, we want justice 
Bless up, you know what, youre right, Im gonna fix this
But before I do, all of you take these butter sticks
And rub them on your bodies, do it!
Oh, shit!
Thats perfect, yeah
Now lay down in the hot sun 
Do not move til youre well done 
Another one
Major meat alert!
I ate the meat, the meat, the meat
Of Chance, Quavo, Wayne, and JB
I got breasts music
Another one
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think it should be somethin
That I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Now lemme start off by saying this
I never let another woman do what you did
And I held myself back from ever talking shit
Cause I swore to always be the bigger man and never diss
But what youve been doing has got me really pissed
So you better stop telling people that we fucking kissed
Cause we didnt and you know thats some middle school shit
All we were was just friends, good friends that it
So for all the times that you told lies about me
Or when you said I was cheating on Sky with Emily
Or even when you lied to about my sexuality
I dont have time to care and I couldnt if I tried
So girl, if your gonna talk shit get your facts straight
And its a fact that we never went on one date
So if you think Im still holding on get some help
Cause baby you should go and fuck yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself

I wanna ride, I wanna ride, I just wanna ride with you
This is funky
Yeah
Ready?
Lets go
A.T.L., baby, is where I reside
Im a young white rapper and I dont get high
Teenage girls is what I really like
And Im still a young boy but Im still so fly
Yeah, you see my smile caught it on the cam-er-a
Drink a Red Bull grew wings see the stamina
Shout out to my boys, yeah, theyre up there in Canada
I used to live there til I moved to Atlanta
Where the girls are so hot, here the girls are fine too
Catching Bieber fever, forget the swine flu
Can I be the one to take you round town?
Be the one to call when youre feeling so down?
I could be your man
You could be my crown
Im J. Bieber, first name last name!
J. Bieber, check it on the past lane!
J. Bieber, im always in the fast lane!
Yeah uh
Jai toujours cru
Que lon pouvait vivre quelque chose de bien
Quelque chose de bien
Un reve du soir qui nous maintient loin de croire que tout ira Bien
Que tout ira bien
Dis au revoir aux jours les plus sombres
Le bonheur a quelques secondes
Je ne te laisse pas tomber
Ne me laisse pas tomber
Ce fut un enfer sans fin
Un enfer qui battait son plein
Je ne te laisse pas tomber
Ne me laisse pas tomber
Nabandonne pas... non.. non.. non..
Jnabandonnerai pas.. non.. non.. non..
Laisse-moi taimer
Laisse-moi taimer
Nabandonne pas... non.. non.. non..
Jnabandonnerai pas.. non.. non.. non..
Laisse-moi taimer
Laisse-moi taimer
Ne tendors pas
Car devant nous nous avons beaucoup de kilometres
De kilometres
Ce dont on a besoin
Cest de se reveiller pour savoir quon est assez bien
Quon est assez bien
Dis au revoir aux jours les plus sombres
Le bonheur a quelques secondes
Je ne te laisse pas tomber
Ne me laisse pas tomber
Ce fut un enfer sans fin
Un enfer qui battait son plein
Je ne te laisse pas tomber
Ne me laisse pas tomber
Nabandonne pas... non.. non.. non..
Jnabandonnerai pas.. non.. non.. non..
Laisse-moi taimer
Laisse-moi taimer
Nabandonne pas... non.. non.. non..
Jnabandonnerai pas.. non.. non.. non..
Laisse-moi taimer
Laisse-moi taimer
Nabandonne pas... non.. non.. non..
Jnabandonnerai pas.. non.. non.. non..
Laisse-moi taimer
Laisse-moi taimer
OHo, oHo, oHo, oHo
Je nte laisse pas tomber
Nme laisse pas tomber nan..
Je nte laisse pas tomber
Nme laisse pas tomber nan..
Nabandonne pas.. non.. non.. non..
Je nte laisserai pas.. non.. non.. non..
Laisse-moi taimer.. laisse-moi taimer..
Nabandonne pas.. non.. non.. non..
Je nte laisserai pas.. non.. non.. non..
Laisse-moi taimer.. laisse-moi taimer..
Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way to far away
T.V light blue and white
I just cant fall asleep tonight
Move over to the space where you should be
Even after you seem so far
Over mountains and diamond stars
Everybody has their own way home
Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away
All my life I've dreamed of love
Never thought it would hurt this much
Kiss goodbye await for your return
Oh whoa
So I'll be strong and hold onto
The picture and the thought of you
Getting all the love that you deserve
Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away
If home is where you are
Home is way too far away
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Said There's another, and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we aint together
And I wanna play it cool, but Im losing you
Ill buy you anything, Ill buy you any ring
And Im in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me til you wake me from this bad dream
Im going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And Im like
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Feeling so good, so great
Until I really look into your eyes
Tell me how bad it is, what you did
Cause you know that Im not about that life
Your secrets have secrets, thats no lie
Why we gotta be so under the weather
We can only have ourselves, cant rely on nobody else
To put your pieces back together
Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find?
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we dont understand
Why do they lie?
Itll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide 
Easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide
Never would give you away
Youll be unfamiliar with pain
Youll never cry
Ive been feeling down for a while
Wishing you could see beyond my eyes
You know very well what I did
Swear that Im not about that life
I told you my secrets that made you cry
Said you want the truth thought itd make you feel better
We can only grow from here
Do reconstruction
And put the pieces back together 
Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find? 
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we dont understand
Why do they lie?
Itll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide 
Itll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide
Yeah, If I told you that I miss you
Would you understand it?
Or would you take it for granted?
I miss the little things, talks about the stars and the planets
And you speaking to me in Spanish, Te extrano
Cant even lie
Lately things have been different
You was my sweet tooth
Now it seems I need a filling
And now that the pain is numb, Im looking for a feeling
The fast life isnt as appealing
You still listening?
If you are, I wonder how you have been nowadays
I know we havent talked much since we parted ways
I know I missed your birthday, a couple of holidays
I never knew itd be this hard with you far away
Secrets, all this over some secrets
I look back and tell myself to keep it
I wish that I had looked you in the eye and just told you a lie
Cause I cared too much to see you cry
Itll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide 
Itll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
Shine on me tomorrow: let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be, let it be
M-M-Murda
He laid down his life, paid the price, yeah, get that

And aint it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still dont believe em

You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Dont think I fit in at this party
Everyones got so much to say 
I always feel like Im nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
Cause I dont care when Im with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And youre making me feel like Im loved by somebody

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I dont care
Cause I dont care

With all these people all around
Im crippled with anxiety
But Im told its where Im sposed to be
You know what? Its kinda crazy cause I really dont mind
When you make it better like that
Dont think we fit in at this party
Everyones got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said Im sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay
Cause I dont care when Im with my baby, yeah

They try to bring me down, but I won't stop
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop
'Til Im gone man, I won't stop, no
I, I see them coming, coming
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop
Until Im dead man, I won't stop, yeah
Yeah, I think they mad cause Im driving in the fast lane
But Ive been grinding for years, ask hype game
It's funny how stuff doesn't change
From sleeping in the car to copping me that Range
Im all world star, and all them other blogs
All them haters hating cause I am a heart throb
But do I want it all?
All the negativity is not gon get rid of me
Im here to make history, Im speaking it real
Back track to the days when I aint have me a deal, yeah
So Imma show the world that Im ill
Every beat that I get on best believe Imma kill
So you can have all the jewellery, have all the cars
Have all the fame, have all the broads
You can have the fact that Im a star
Just so you can listen to these bars
I see them coming see them coming, yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop
'Til Im dead man, I won't stop, no
I, I see them coming, coming
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop
Until Im dead man, I won't stop, no
Yeah, they talk, yeah, they talk, they don't walk the walk I walk
I won't stop til I drop, until then, I reach the top
Imma rock to where I need to be, walk the path of destiny
Definitely been neglected, but God is always testing me
Rest in peace to all the men that died that were protecting me
Objectively, I need to tell you what just gets the best of me
Essentially, people in this world just wanna let it be
A lot of men aint different though, just let it be, set it free
Never be scared to make change, effectively
Always look at things from different ways, perspectively
Every person in this world can do good
I just want this message understood
Alright stop, everybody's gotta listen
Make the decision to envision a better place with no division
Religion, everybody needs a mission
Haters need to stop it, just listen
I see them coming, yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop
'Til Im gone man, I won't stop, no
I, I see them coming, coming
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop
Until Im dead, man, I won't stop, no
For whatever reason
I feel like Ive been wanting you all my life
You dont understand
Im so glad were at the same place
At the same time
Its over now
I spotted you dancin
You made all the boys stare
Those lips and your brown eyes 
And the sexy hair

Picture this
Summer morning, breakfast
Sunrise, sunny side up
See me smiling when I see you rise up
Private island, tryna turn your life up
We dont need a night club if youre tryna get wifed up
Yeah, baby, do you wanna take it there?
Do you wanna take it there, take it there?
Do you wanna make it there, make it there, make it there?
Do you wanna just stay in there and then wait in there?
Can you wait in there?
Just lay it down, just lay it down, just lay it down
Lay it down right there, lay it down, lay it down right there
Lay it down, lay it down right there, lay it down, lay it down right there
Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there

High to give a damn, yeah, Im too
Fly to give a damn, yeah, Im high
I dont give a damn, Im from a
Place like Amsterdam, I just got some head in Rotterdam

Look at my old clan tryna sue the man
Might go get a Benz, might go get the Ford
Might go get the Lamb off the showroom floor
Bitch, I been ready, mark, set, lets go
I just do my thing and these niggas know

You still cant get enough, you still cant get enough
You still cant get enough, no
Im giving you all my love, it still aint enough
You still cant get enough, oh no
If I bought you a beach house, you would ask for the ocean
If I take you you would want to go higher, baby
And first I thought that you needed, acts of service babe
And now I think different, now I think different, oh
You still cant get enough, you still cant get enough

You still cant get enough, oh no
You still cant get enough, you still cant get enough

Loving you is my mission
I know I can make a difference, woah
I got responsibilities
And Im never gonna leave 
Loving you is my mission
My one and only mission
I see you and only you
And Ill prove it now
Tunnel visions got me focused on you
Im aware of your needs and Ill hold you down
Ill even scratch that little part on your neck, I know you like that
Over and over again

Oh girl I need you by my side 
You can say whatever you may like 
You can tell me anything but just as long as you dont say goodbye 
Girl 
Youve got a million things to say 
Oh baby dont leave me this way 
Youve got me out there all alone 
Girl 
All in my head, I see your face 
The memories wont go away 
Im so alone 
Oh girl I need you by my side 
You can say whatever may you like 
You can tell me anything but just as long as you dont say goodbye 
I never wanna see you cry
You can say whatever in your mind 
Just as long as you dont say goodbye 
Please dont say goodbye
And girl
Cant you hear me calling your name? 
I know that Im the one to blame 
Dont shut the door and keep it closed 
Keep it closed
Girl 
All in my head, I see your face 
The memories wont go away 
Im all alone 
Oh girl I need you by my side 
You can say whatever may you like 
You can tell me anything but just as long as you dont say goodbye 
I never wanna see you cry
You can say whatever in your mind 
You can tell me anything but just as long as you dont say goodbye 
Whered we go wrong?
Why cant we get along?
Listen to me, dont tell me youre gone, gone
Dont tell me youre gone, dont tell me youre gone
Whered we go wrong?
Why cant we get along?
Listen to me, dont tell me youre gone, gone 
Dont tell me youre gone, dont tell me youre gone
Whered we go wrong?
Why cant we get along?
Listen to me, dont me youre gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Whered we go wrong?
Why cant we get along? 
Dont tell me youre gone, dont tell me youre gone
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin with some girls Ive never seen before
She told me dont worry about it
She told me dont worry no more
Cause I cant feel my face when Im with you
But I love it, but I love it
What do you mean? Ooh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Oh oh oh
What do you mean?
Oh, late night, when you needed my love
Oh, late night when you needed it most
Cause I know when that hotline bling
We were gonna be something
Yeah, I know when that hotline bling
We were gonna be something
Ill make you believe
I heard youre looking for somebody to treat you right
Cause them other guys dont live up to their height
I heard youre looking for somebody to smack your heart
Cause they going, they shot before you start
You aren't got to search no further
I got what you want 
Im not trying to waste your time by telling you what you want 
They can make you promises but I
Ill make you believe
Believe, believe, believe 
Believe, believe, believe 
Believe, believe, believe 
They can make you promises, but I
Ill make you believe
I heard you're looking for somebody to take control
Baby, give me the green light and well go
So let me love you, till my heart stops
Let me touch you, when the beat drops
Right there
You aren't got to search no further
I got what you want 
Im not trying to waste your time by telling you what you want 
They can make you promises but I
Ill make you believe
Believe, believe, believe 
Believe, believe, believe 
Believe, believe, believe 
They can make you promises but I
Ill make you believe
Lyrics from Snippet
Said youre amazing
She said you must be crazy
I said, No, Im not, well, a little maybe
And I dont talk a lot
But when I do, I mean it
And I swear I know an angel
Baby when I see you
I know I do have issues
But aint got to do with you
Not gonna lie, girl, I miss you
No, it aint superficial
We spent beautiful moments
And some beautiful dream
But aint nothing more beautiful
Than you were next to me
And I got a couple things
Oh, girl, youre not my type
Oh, least its how it used to be
Oh, never stayed the night
Oh, til you took one look at me
Even though Im sober, Im still buzzing-uzzing, yeah
Even though Im stone cold, Im still loving-oving, yeah
Even though I dont deserve all that you doin yeah
Oh, you still bring me back to life
Ayo, I know I got me one
Ayo, I know I got me one
Oh, need lookin, lookin no more
All of them days are done
Cause ayo, I know I got me one
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one
Oh, I forgot the names
Oh, you is all I recognize
Oh, put me in my grave
Oh, you still bring me back to life
Even though Im sober, Im still buzzing-uzzing, yeah
Even though Im stone cold, Im still loving-oving, yeah

As a young man, I didnt understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didnt realize at the time that it wasnt funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance
Thanks to friends and family I learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologized for those wrongs. Now that these mistakes from the past have become public I need to apologize again to all those I have offended
Im very sorry. I take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and I apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake. I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again
Ignorance has no place in our society and I hope the sharing of my faults can prevent others from making the same mistake in the future. I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say but telling the truth is always whats right
Five years ago I made a reckless and immature mistake and Im grateful to those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man. Once again.... Im sorry
This the Rock City, Justin Bieber remix to Sorry
You aint been answering the phone
And I know you seeing me calling

Girl, you be tripping, youre too insecure
Dem other girl way too bad to ignore

Take something and wave it
Take something and wave it
I used to believe
We were burnin on the edge of somethin beautiful
Somethin beautiful
Sellin a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, its been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when were feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldnt be drowning on your own
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you cant afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We aint ever getting older
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Dont want to, but I cant put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And Ill never be her
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I miss you when I cant sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I cant eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we dont remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too
And Im always tired but never of you
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now Im lookin pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I cant stop
No, I-I-I cant stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you cant afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We aint ever getting older
We aint ever getting older
We aint ever getting older
We aint ever getting older
We aint ever getting older
I wont let go, no no, no no, no more
Ill be your lifeline tonight
Ill be your lifeline tonight
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Dont want to, but I cant put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And Ill never be her
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said youre running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're so indecisive, what I'm saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Dont know if youre happy or complaining
Dont want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First youre up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know...
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said youre running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You want to make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, wont let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First youre up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know...
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean? 
Said youre running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said youre running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
When you was just a young'un you're looks but so precious
But now you're grown up
So fly its like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
I just want to take my time
I just want to do my thing
Maybe we press rewind
Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our soul together
Find out how to love, kiss and hug
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Baby we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We could go into the night
Youre the one I need
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don't want to listen
But I admire your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
Its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
I just want you to know
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I dont do too well with apologies
I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Ill take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
Ill go, Ill go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im not just trying to get you back on me
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?

You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im cryin on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself 
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong 
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself 
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that cause Im not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Woah-oh-oh
And I was like
Baby, baby, baby oh
Baby, baby, baby oh
Baby, baby, baby oh
I thought youd always be mine, mine
You know you love me

Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me, made me aware what I was missin
Been missin the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought Id settle down, I can not lie to myself
I was busy focusin on bein by myself
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on the shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin left
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin up all alone aint better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know its hard babe to sleep at night
Dont you worry, cause everythings gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Dont you worry, cause everythings gonna be alright
Be alright
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms and holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you
And everythings gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Dont you worry, cause everythings gonna be alright
Be alright
You know that I care for you
Ill always be there for you
Promise Ill just stay right here
I know that you want me too
Baby, we can make it through anything
Cause everythings gonna be alright

Through the sorrow and the fights
Dont you worry, cause everythings gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Dont you worry
Cause everythings gonna be alright

Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles til Im at the greyhound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But Im still thinking bout what my mother would say
As Im singing an old song she used to sing
When things werent going the way she wanted them to
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But shell be worried sick if I do if I do
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy mamas boy
Just dont run off and leave my mama at home
Cause Im her boy mamas boys
Just dont run away, run away
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy
Mamas boy just dont
So I turn around and headed to the old run-down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back
I watch the upper-classmen drive right past me
Wish theyd let me ride away with them
Still havent got over it yet
Its been playing in my ears all morning I swear
My iPods the same tune my mother would sing
When things werent going the way she wanted them to
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But shell be worried sick if I do if I do
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy mamas boy
Just dont run off and leave my mama at home
Cause Im her boy mamas boys
Just dont run away, run away
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy
Mamas boy just dont
Never get mad enough to walkout
If I do then I wont be gone for long
Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what Ill love her just the same
Thats my mama, yeah
So no matter what I aint leaving unless shes coming soon
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy mamas boy
Just dont run off and leave my mama at home
Cause Im her boy mamas boys
Just dont run away, run away
Cant run away and leave my mama alone
Cause Im her boy
Mamas boy just dont

No limit in the sky
That I wont fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I wont cry for ya, oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
Theres no promise that I wont keep
Ill climb a mountain, theres none too steep
When it comes to you
Theres no crime
Lets take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Dont be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you
Cupid aint a lie
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Dont miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Aint gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, its yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh
When it comes to you
Theres no crime
Lets take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Dont be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think it should be somethin
That I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think it should be somethin
That I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
I gave you the key when the door wasnt open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me here, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldnt find you anywhere
When you broke down I didnt leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
I gave you attention when nobody else was paying, hmmm
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing, thats for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying, oh Lord
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
I need you, I need you, I need you, ...
Where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most
Let me start off with the old school flow
Let me start off with the old school flow
Snap back, backpack, rat-a-tat, go
Swagger at the knapsack, who know I could rap that?
Tell me where the cash at, Ill tell you where the smash at
Number one hits, I got number one flicks
And the number one kicks and number one chicks
Fast like Gordon and my jams like Jordan
And my Tims like Hortons and my jets all aboarded in
And my wheels are like a fortune and it feels like extortion
Is it for the fame or for the fortune?
Like this, mic this so I can re-sight this
People in their basements say that I didnt write this
People say Im white so I couldnt do it like this
Checks like Nike. let me give you a good night kiss
Well Im a little bit sick of it, listening to bickering
Like picking on a little kid, like taking all his licorice
I hate it when they littering, I hate to be illiterate
I literally am doing deeds, riddling
Cheese like Gouda and my soul like Buddha
And Imma go right through you and Im so much cooler
And I dont need Luda
To know that Im the ruler a
And Im, so much cooler
You should call me Ferris Bueller

They dont understand the way I fell in love with a Cancer 
Probably why they make shit up at random

From the one that Im havin now with the pilot 
He said, Turbulence where we goin, it could get rocky 
But the journey aint for everybody, I aint worried bout it

And days we save as souvenirs

Unashamed to say the name, I keep it blatant in every statement

We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me

Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl

Love is a powerful thing 
I just wanna know if youre ready 
Can we go on the distance? 
The distance 
Can we go on the distance? 
The distance 
All you gotta, baby
You gotta keep your hand up 
No tappin out 
No shortcuts, no slowin down
Gotta go the distance
Ooh, the distance
Til the distance is over now
Ooh wee , Ooh wee 
Ooh wee 
Yeah, ayy
Well just sleep tonight
But the morning
Go home, change clothes and be back by the afternoon
We could bring in the evening
Bring it in together
When I go in
You gotta go in with me
When I turn up
You gotta turn up with me
When I want some more
Gotta some more with me
No more questioning
Can we go on the distance? 
The distance 
Can we go on the distance? 
The distance
All you gotta, baby
You gotta keep your hand up 
No tappin out 
No shortcuts, no slowin down
Gotta go the distance
Ooh, the distance
Til the distance is over now
Ooh wee , Ooh wee 
Ooh wee 
Yeah, ayy
If were arguing
Cause we disagree
You swear that Im telling a lie
Would you ever believe in me?
Sometimes it rains
Would you stay in the rain with me?
When it doesnt rain
Would you stand in the sun with me?
When Im feeling pain
Would you feel the pain with me?
If its too much too handle, let me know
Can we go on the distance? 
The distance 
Can we go on the distance? 
The distance 
All you gotta, baby 
You gotta keep your hand up 
No tappin out 
No shortcuts, no slowin down
Gotta go the distance
Ooh, the distance
Til the distance is over now
Ooh wee , Ooh wee 
Ooh wee 
Yeah, ayy
Por cada vez que me hiciste llorar
Y enves de hablarme, preferias pelear
Talvez pensaste que me ibas a lastimar
Pero al contrario, el dano me hiso triunfar
Y ya no escribire de ti
Porque no quiero que la gente piense que me importas
Tu en mi mente no estas
Mi vida seguira sin ti
Y yo te aseguro, que lo nuestro ya quedo atras
Es tiempo que sepas
Mama, no te quiere, tu no le caes bien
Papa ya no quiere, que contigo yo este
Y fui tan ciega que no vi, lo que hacias detras de mi
Pero ya si, ahora me toca a mi decir
Si la felicidad, nunca te di
Hoy me despido, ve y quierete a ti
Y si en verdad te vez mejor sin mi
Pues buena suerte, ve y quierete a ti
Tu me decias que mi amiga no era fiel
Mis opiniones no querias saber
Siempre intentaste de alejarme de quien soy
Lograste hacerlo ayer, pero no lo haras hoy
Y ya no escribire de ti
Porque no quiero que la gente piense que me importas
Tu en mi mente no estas
Mi vida seguira sin ti
Y yo te aseguro, que lo nuestro ya quedo atras
Es tiempo que sepas
Mama, no te quiere, tu no le caes bien
Papa ya no quiere, que contigo yo este
Y fui tan ciega que no vi, lo que hacias detras de mi
Pero ya si, ahora me toca a mi decir
Si la felicidad, nunca te di
Hoy me despido, ve y quierete a ti
Y si en verdad te vez mejor sin mi
Pues buena suerte, ve y quierete a ti
Por cada vez me hiciste llorar
Y me llenaste de inseguridad
Fui vulnerable no me supe valorar
Pero tu amor me enseno a amarme mas
Si la felicidad, nunca te di
Hoy me despido, ve y quierete a ti
Y si en verdad te vez mejor sin mi
Pues buena suerte, ve y quierete a ti
Cause if you like, the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if think, that I'm still holding on
To something, you should go and love yourself
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
Pues buena suerte, ve y quierete a ti

[Crazy In Love: Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave Im begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How Im feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Cause I know I dont understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your loves got me looking so crazy right now 
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now 
Got me hoping youll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping youll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your loves got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
You might see me in a Lambo
Camo snapback, Rambo
500 horses, Django
2 2 chicken, Nando
You might see me in a Rari
Old school fella, Atari
Its a new dance, no tango
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
Hey, hey, Fester
Hey, hey, Fester
Anywhere I go, I make the gang go
Hey, hey, Fester
Hey, hey Fester
Where are you now that we need you?
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But Ill be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Dont you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But Ill be damned if I see another chick on your arm
She gon be rockin chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon take everything I own
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
In the Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I cant let you go
Damned if let you go
Picture perfect, you dont need no filter
Gorgeous, make em drop dead, its a thriller
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, youre an asset
Make sure that you dont need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Shout-out to your mom and dad for teachin you
Standin ovation, they did a great job raisin you
When I create, youre my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Cant nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean look, I cant refuse 
Picture perfect, you dont need no filter
Gorgeous, make em drop dead, its a thriller
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, youre an asset
Make sure that you dont need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Already pass, you dont need no approval
Good everywhere, dont worry bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Dont need a sponsor, nope, youre the brand now
Youre my rock, my Colorado
Get that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
Thats how I feel, act like you know that you are
Picture perfect, you dont need no filter
Gorgeous, make em drop dead, its a thriller
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin up, got your own bread 
Heart full of equity, youre an asset 
Make sure that you dont need no mentions 
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Only intentions
Thats all I plan to do
Powietrze jest lekkie
Sumienie jest ciezkie
Myslenie jest grzeszne
Pocieszmy sie bez nich
Probuje szczescie
Czuje jak tester
Jestem powszechna i smiertelna
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said youre running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
To chyba moj pech, ze...
Nie mialbym nic bez farta
Lenistwo to moj ulubiony grzech
Ale nie osiadam na laurach jak Petrarca
Wlasnie sie koncze zaczynac
Jeszcze poczekasz, az sie zaczne konczyc
Chodz tu i zobacz jak fajnie nawijam, chwila!
Moze bys sie fajnie przylaczyl?
Nie ma tego zlego, co by nie wyszlo na dobre - taki progress, ze chyla mi czola i... tu
Nie ma tego zlego, co by nie wyszlo na dobre; Miuosh i Onar? Csss....
Dla mnie nie ma tych, ktorych nie slucham
Sa ze mna Ci, ktorych nie slychac
Nie zjadaja mnie nerwy, to ja zjadam nerwy; pycha
Wyciagam kafla za kaflem, dla mnie ten biznes to Yenga
Nie wydaje mi sie, zebys tak nawinal kiedykolwiek, chlopcze! Choc sie nie oszczedzam
Bez umiaru, lece nad wyraz jak potega
Parys, Pepe w Realu, SB Maffija, wbijam, zeby ich deptac po pietach
Powietrze jest lekkie
Sumienie jest ciezkie
Myslenie jest grzeszne
Pocieszmy sie bez nich
Probuje szczescie
Czuje jak tester
Jestem powszechna i smiertelna
I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
Cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
Plyne pod prad i tak lapie dystans
Wymyslam flow i stad pryskam
Oni chca mnie skonczyc 
Ze zdumienia przecieraja oczy
Bo kazdy z nich wie, wie, wie, wie, wie, wie
Ze lece tu jak chce
Nie powstrzyma mnie nie, nie, nie, nie, nie
Lece wysoko, lece wysoko
Przeskakuje na wyzszy level
Jestem coraz dalej od ciebie
Juz dwa razy drozszy refren
Lece wysoko
Lece wysoko, lece wysoko
Lece wysoko, lece wysoko
Lece wysoko, lece wysoko
Lece wysoko, lece wysoko
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said youre running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

I want your body, I just want you
I want a hot night with a thousand things to do
I am not in Pop Culture
Over the Bitch of Pop
A warm night, a crazy dream
Give me your body 
You know what I want 
The weather was a detail
His touch and kisses
My mind was simple
I want to collapse
Even if its with you
The Beautiful was the soul
And it became just you 
Give me one night of love 
I want it to float, like music in the air
I want is his body in half measures will abuse
You talk I obey, not only want fame
I want success, united, pop and power
Move me for sex, hot night 
I want to collapse
A night of pleasure just me and you
Want it now 
I want that moment 
You are my drug 
My way to lose 
I want you 
I want to be happy and crazy
Youre my addiction
Fame, success, spotlight is my power
You are my drug, and sex will drive me mad
Im not a kid anymore, I own the Moment Bitch
Reaches the end, I want to be with you
Give me what I want, you want me
Suffice to say, leave me without action
Make me crazy
Of what I want 
I want you

All the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own, but I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinkin I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, I didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin

Doo doo doo doo doo...
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
You used to control how I think, we used to be in a sync
I used to speak way too much, you used to know everything
I dont understand you, you dont understand me
You told me stop being shy, but you stay being shy too
Your renege got me butt hurt
Throwing names in the dirt
The desire was at your place
But at those dates and time I was too young for you
But now we are free, now Im confused and lost without you
And now I search all around for someone who acts like you
Wishin it were me and you
We gon get it poppin  
We gon get it Jukin
We gon throw a party
We aint gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up with for the weekend
Rolling with your parties
So tell me what you thinkin
So we gon have a juke jam
So we gon have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
Ill get close to you
I remember you
You used to "I remember you" cause
Weve got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe Im crazy
Crazy about you
You never understand what I think
I can never understand what you think
You can only smile and wink
I cant tell if your my missing link
You got a nigga, shit I cant stand it
So when Im feeling down, I sit around
Wishing you were around
I mean we were just flirting
And its stupid as fuck
I wrote so many stories call them scripts
You need to know the truth so come to grips
So tell me why you ignore
It's getting so frustrating
I'm debating on calling but I keep annotating
So now I'll just keep waiting
Weve got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe Im crazy
Crazy about you
We gon get it poppin  
We gon get it Jukin
We gon throw a party
We aint gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up with for the weekend
Rolling with your parties
So tell me what you thinkin
So we gon have a juke jam
So we gon have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
Ill get close to you
I remember you
You used to "I remember you"
Everybody's looking for you
But it hurts when he finally finds you
Still we hold on
I know you are no good for me
Try to believe in something, holding on to nothing
The clothes on a mannequin, they have no meaning
So quick to lead me on and let me down
Tell me why you gotta be deceiving
In my opinion, that's the reason
You're overrated, overrated, overrated
You're overrated, overrated
In my opinion, that's the reason
You're overrated
Everybody always crying over you
'Cause they fell so hard for you
Tryna move on, forget that you're broken-hearted
Lying to yourself, holding on to nothing
The clothes on a mannequin, they have no meaning
So quick to lead me on and let me down
Tell me why you gotta be deceiving
In my opinion, that's the reason
You're overrated, overrated, overrated
You're overrated, overrated
In my opinion, that's the reason
You're overrated

Lyrics from Snippet
I get my peaches out in Georgia
I aint ever gotta act hard
She aint ever seen a black card
Shes a runner, shes a track star
Im posted in Atlanta, Georgia, ooh, yes, yes
I put some really pretty diamonds on your neck
I buy Chanel like every weekend, so whats next?
Have you ever had good sex on a jet?
Where the album at? I dont really know
But what I do know, I wanna fuck with you
Girl, you cold
Girl, you cool
Youre the salt and pepper
Oh, girl, you smooth

I get my weed from California 
I took my chick up to the North, yeah 
I get my life right from the source, yeah 
I love you good in Arizona
You can hop on a jet
Just set a little vibe, might be time for sex
Shawty goin around, doin all the tricks
Turn you in late, like a new project
I got my peaches out in Georgia 
I get my weed from California 
I took my chick up to the North, yeah 
I get my light right from the source, yeah 
And I say, oh 
The way I breathe you in 
Its the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh

Its the way you lift me up, yeah
And Ill be right here with you til the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia 
I get my weed from California 
I took my chick up to the North, yeah 
I get my light right from the source, yeah 
I get my weed from Kali Kuta

I took my chick up to the North, yeah 
I get my light right from the source, yeah
Youre all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Yo, I think about you when I wake up
The last thing on my mind before I go to sleep
You heard my song said, It was pretty deep
Next thing we know, we under covers and Im pretty deep
God damn, I got the type of shit that make you weak
After we finish you can barely speak, catch your breath
I bent you over the kitchen sink
I wrote this song as soon as you left
But it aint about the sex though
Its a feeling I cant let go
A lotta letters you always end with an XO
A lotta fights, we a mess though
Screaming til my throat hurts like a nigga got strep throat
You the best at calming a nigga down
I feel lost when youre not around
I need a text or a call, Im obsessed, Im meant all
You the best that I saw, keep me on the ground
You feel lost in a shuffle, music is my hustle
I do it for the both of us so we aint gotta struggle
You should know by now, I never put nothing above you
So now you better wear that dress I like you in or you in trouble
Matter fact, you in trouble either way
Pass the love, baby, lead the way
I fly you to the show tonight, you leave today
I think you already know what I dont need to say
Youre all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, there aint no I in team
I need you to believe that youre all that matters to me
Youre all that matters to me
And I dont even sing, but Im singing for you
Tryna get you in sheets and do things to you
What you think? We aint leaving the room for a week or two
Fucking around, one take, download at onlyfuturistic.com
Or Imma fuck your mom and your little sister nigga
Yeah and Imma tell her, youre all that matters to me, yeah
I need you, I need you
I need you the most
I need you the most
I gave you the key when the door wasnt open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now Im all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you? Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya? Couldnt find you anywhere
When you broke down I didnt leave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the most
I gave you the key when the door wasnt open, just admit it
That was a good one

You with your friends, talking about some bullshit
Ever since we ended, youve been saying some cruel shit
Wont let it phase me, thats that foul shit
If I act like I care you see thats when I lose it
Girl its funny, we went from XOs to Exs
Some real love shit till it ended like a sentence
Arguing for nothing, all that fighting was senseless
But now youre saying shit, spreading lies, talking reckless
Damn, thought you was real, I guess not
Thought you was the one so I gave it my best shot
Now Im married to the rodent, hes rested up
Still drinking, about to sipping down his twelve shots
Shit, sprite too much, right?
All these girls in my phone, shit I just might
My new chick gonna be what you shouldve been
Dont be trying to hit me up when you find out what you couldve of been
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Its 2016 now, everything is changing
Ladies hit me up, its like every bitch is paging
Messing with girls, thats risking everything Im chasing
I started with a dream, so Im sticking with the basics
Face it, girl, cause you know I love the stage
Different city every week, you think Im trying to runaway
But I aint begging you, you should know when I stay
But I gotta make the moves if I wanna run the game
Im just trying to make a name for the kid and my city
Swacking from nothing, I was living hella shitty
Had a dollar and a dream, moshed it up and got it busy
Told whoever coming with me, we aint stopping till we drizzy
But girl where were you when I needed you most
You went vacant and turned into a ghost
See you never replied when I needed to cope
And now youre steady trying to hit up my phone
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
I hear a lot about sinners
Dont think that Ill be a saint
But I might go down to the river
Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, its making me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Running to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I dont do well with the drama
And, no, I cant stand it being fake
I dont believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I cant explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say were too young and
The pimps and the players say, Dont go crushin
Wise men say fools rush in
But I dont know 
They say were too young and
The pimps and the players say, Dont go crushin
Wise men say fools rush in
But I dont know
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second, on God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second, on God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy

Its the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Imma be under the mistletoe
I dont wanna miss out on the holiday
But I cant stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Imma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
Everyones gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But Imma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street Santas coming tonight
Reindeers flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But Imma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
Ay love, the wise men followed the star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Ay love, dont you buy me nothing
Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
Thats a merry merry Christmas
Its the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Imma be under the mistletoe
I dont wanna miss out on the holiday
But I cant stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Imma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
Everybody knows my name now
But somethin bout it still feels strange
Like lookin in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when Im older, itll all calm down
But its killin me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then youd know me
Cause Ive had everything
But no ones listening
And thats just Oh So lonely
Im so lonely
Lonely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe thats the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a ----
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then youd know me
Cause Ive had everything
But no ones listening
And thats just Oh So lonely
Im so lonely
Lonely
Im so lonely
Lonely
Comin over in my direction
So thankful for that, its such a blessin, yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long
!Oh! Tu, tu eres el iman y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso 
Ya, ya me esta gustando mas de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo mas
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningun apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estas conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le ensenes a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos 
Dejame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido
Si te pido un beso, ven, damelo, yo se que estas pensandolo
Llevo tiempo intentandolo, mami, esto es dando y dandolo
Sabes que tu corazon conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba esta buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver como te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuanto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, despues salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tu me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa montarlo aqui tengo la pieza
!Oye!
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estas conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le ensenes a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos 
Dejame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, !Ay, Bendito!
I can move forever cuando este contigo
!Bailalo!
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le ensenes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido 
Despacito
Justin Bieber and 3pac, so cute
Oh my god
Your loves so deep, you know that it humbles me 
Youre by my side, them troubles them not trouble me 
Many have called but the chosen is you 
Whatever you want shawty Ill give it to you
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight 
My breath is your breath 
When youre hurt, Im not right
Damn girl, Im so cute
Cuter than Justin Bieber, thats the truth
Im doing what I wanna I dont give no hoots
Im the beast in the booth, thats all I do
Ive been getting cheddar, getting cheddar
Sugar momma know I get the cheddar
Yeah son and I get the bread, you heard what I said
Justin Bieber is my friend, but Im cuter
I dont give a hoot, were riding on our scooters
We are the cutest in the game and everybody knows our names
All these ladies wanna do is play with our wieners
We dont give a hoot so we give the girls our wieners
We got big wieners but mines way bigger
Shawty right there
Shes got everything I need 
And Ima tell her one time 
Give you everything you need , down to my last dime
I remember when Justin and I were just babies
Taking baths together and it was so fun
I had the best time of my life
When we took baths
It was so cool
And thats why were such macs
And all the ladies say that were so cute together
And our song is the best song ever made in the world
Everybody loves us cause were so cute and beautiful
I dont give a hoot, Im so unusual
But, Im gonna keep on spitting no writtens
Im going ham
Baby know I am the man, baby know I got the plan
Yeah baby, you know we get the money
We get the cheddar son, it aint even funny
She makes me happy, I know where Ill be
Right by her side cause she is the one for me

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when were feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldnt be drowning on your own
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
Its how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you til Im old
You shouldnt be fighting on your own
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
Im all alone
And I hope, I hope someones gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you wont let go
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
I got my peaches out in Georgia 
I got my dream with California 
I took my friend up to the north, yeah 
I get my light right from the source, yeah 
And I see you , the way I breathe you in 
Its the feeling from within
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby

Days alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs

Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldnt hold her

I get my light right from the source, yeah 
I get the feeling, so Im sure 
Hand in my hand because Im yours

Don't think you wanna know just where Ive been, oh

The one I need is right in my arms 
Your singing sounds sweeter with mine
And Ill be right here with you til the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia 
I got my dream with California 
I took my friend up to the north, yeah 
I get my light right from the source, yeah 
I got my peaches out in Georgia

And we took a look at it
Your body like a weapon, automatic
Girl, eyes on you now

She whipped the whip 
Specially when she talk sexually

What you say, is what you believe
Everybody wants a piece of me
Im so alive, but I still can't breathe
From the presence that surrounded me
Present, thats anxiety
So lost in it, push it to the limit
So lost in it, oh
Anxiety
So lost in it, push it to the limit
So lost in it, oh
Need a second, need a minute, need a moment
Coming up in front of you, it aint easy
Running all over but the world still needs me
Gotta stay reloaded
Need a day, need a month, need a year off
'Cause Im not tough when you dont miss me, feel anxiety
What you say, is what you believe
Everybody wants a piece of me
Im so alive, but I still cant breathe
From the presence that surrounded me
Present, thats anxiety
So lost in it, push it to the limit
So lost in it, oh

Now who you choose?

I got a penthouse out in Sunset, so come through, okay, girl
Holla if you down the road, cause I got the fire then I gotta roll
And I got the diamonds and they on the go
Hey, Im off the Y and Im about to blow, uh-uh
No more time for wasting, time aint got for wasting time
Yeah, Ima keep that girl

And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin, oh Lord
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?

So, lock the door and throw out the key

Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldnt change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you

Now Im all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you? Where are you now?

When you broke down, I didnt leave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin

And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin, oh Lord
Where are you now that I need ya? Couldnt find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didnt leave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?

To tell you Im sorry for everything that Ive done

Hello from the outside 
At least I can say that I tried 
To tell you Im sorry for breaking your heart
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now
Ill take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know theres no innocent one in this game for two
Ill go, Ill go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Cause its no secret that the both of us are running out of time
Hello from the other side

To tell you Im sorry for everything that Ive done
Yeah I know that I let you down

No amount of tears in my eyes

Theres no promise that I wont keep
Ill climb a mountain, theres none too steep

And intertwine
When it comes to you
Dont be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you

I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a love, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were that someone waiting for me
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, youre holding mine
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts are never broken
And times forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone, wait for me to come home
And they say
Shes in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
The worst things in life come free to us
The worst things in life come free to us
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do 
You know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
So come on now, follow my lead
Come on now, follow my lead
Im in love with the shape of you
Im out of touch, Im out of love
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done
I think I love you better now
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think it should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job
Didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think it should be somethin
That I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job
Didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Everybody knows my name now
But somethin bout it still feels strange
Like lookin in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when Im older, itll all calm down
But its killin me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then youd know me
Cause Ive had everything
But no ones listening
And thats just fuckin lonely
Im so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
But maybe thats the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then youd know me
Cause Ive had everything
But no ones listening
And thats just fuckin lonely
Im so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Im so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

You're so indecisive, what I'm saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Dont know if youre happy or complaining
Dont want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First youre up, then you're down and then between

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You want to make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, wont let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First youre up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know...

Oh, what a way to relive that song
Skrip has got some great stuff coming out
Out of sight now, baby
But youre still not out of mind, oh no
Its like youre right here with me
And all my worries fall aside, woah
Planes, cars, and hotels have never been the same
Postcards and notes were, theyre written in your name
Where did we go wrong
And how do we start again
Where did we go wrong
And how do we start again
And how do we start again
How do we start again?
They tell me love is blind
But baby I can see it all, tonight

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when were feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
I hope you know
I wont let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I wont let go
And Ill be your lifeline tonight
Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
Its how we learn and how we grow

And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you

Somewhere I can rest my soul
And I need to know

Ill be your lifeline tonight
And I wont let go

Aye girl
I thought that we were closer
Now it feels like I don't even know her
You would think that I never used to hold her
She believes everything that they told her
She was mad there was girls in the folder
Tried to tell her it was nothing but a photo
She gets advice from a friend that's lonely
I hope she hears these words that I say
Don't listen to your friends
Follow your heart baby and let me in
Follow your heart baby and know that I'm here
You know that I love you girl
So don't have no fear
She don't even talk to me
You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didnt know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didnt think that they would come crashing down, no
You dont have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now theres just no chance
With you and me
Therell never be
And dont it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now its your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasnt like you only talked to him and you know it
Dont act like you dont know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin with my head 
Shouldve picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
You dont have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now theres just no chance
With you and me
Therell never be
And dont it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
All the times that you rained on my parade
All the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh boy, for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own, well I aint
But you still hit my phone up, phone up, phone up
You still hit my phone up, phone up, phone up
And baby Ill be movin on, movin on, movin on
And I think it should be somethin
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin

Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
But Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and fuck yourself
And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
When you tried to tell me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and fuck yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down these walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and fuck yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much

When it comes to you, dont be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you, comes to you

Dont think that Ill be a saint
But I might go down to the river
Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, its makin me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I dont do well with the drama
And, no, I cant stand it being fake
I dont believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life

Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy

The pimps and the players say, Dont go crushin
Wise men say fools rush in
But I dont know 
They say were too young and
The pimps and the players say, Dont go crushin
Wise men say fools rush in
But I dont know
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
Im a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they dont see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Lets take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, brides groom, Im my fathers child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Fathers proud 
If you make it to the water, Hell part the clouds 
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud 
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up 
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust 
I know I aint leavin you like I know He aint leavin us 
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second, on God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second, on God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy
You aint gotta answer none of my calls
Im believing youll pick up one day
I dont wanna add to your pain at all
Im praying that time makes a change in your life
Im realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I dont wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Dont nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what Im saying is
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, dont rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, dont rush, no pressure
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought Id take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin it, Im so delirious
And Ima put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself

I wanna love you all over the place
Dont do it, baby

You think Im playin with your heart like I golf, right?
When I text you, youre so out of sight
Girl youre getting so old, so old, so old
Why you blocked me girl you so cold
Never slept together and that wasnt in my control
You fuckin drive me loco
Dont suppose Id be the one youd hot potato
Oh no, I'm writing bout you again
Ive been thinking of you more than I can comprehend
Last time we talked I lost a little common sense
You taught me a lesson, lost you in expense
And I know youre over me like a dispense
Yeah, you know you expressed yourself like a pretense
Go ahead and take the time
But its a waste of time if your waist aint on mine
Think about it
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Dont rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Dont rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up

Dont rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
Dont rush , no pressure
Say yeah, say yeah

Y tu pensando que yo estaba en la disco
Deja de pelear, que la pasamos mas rico

You think you got it
You got that Yoko Wop
Come do the rabbit
Bounce on my pogo ma
Blushing and laughing
You think I'm loco huh
Come to the jungle
Blow some trees
And get that slow stroke ma
You got a naughty body
I got a matching hobby
Guarantees when you leave
You'll be walking wobbly
We started in the club
Shifted to the lobby
Tipped my pole
Dropped it low
And started screaming pappi
Wanna go again?
Wanna show your friends?
You told them anything this good
You want to share with them
Call them over then
My doorbell rang
Three yokos just walked in
Asking could they join the game
Come on baby girl
Wont you come right here
I got a little secret
Can I whisper in your ear
You're so fly
And `I think that i
Should make that time
With you
I think you got it
Now it's time for me to come get it
You got a bump and I want to romp with it
I got a tongue and I want you to fell it
But right now back up I want you 'pon this here
Drop down and go around round with it
All night long I'ma damn damn hit it
You gon' sing "oh damn C get it"
Yeah I got it and you got a lot more to get
I'm so high girl you gon' get lifted
Up in the air in the club and my bed
You special girl, come come to me
I got a trick you must feel to believe
Come on baby girl
Wont you come right here
I got a little secret
Can I whisper in your ear
You're so fly
And `I think that i
Should make that time
With you
I think you got it
You got that Yoko Wop
Come take my pogo and
Bounce it from the floor to the sky
Come closer girl move in
Promise you when I'm done
Your legs wont stop moving
I'll give it to you so good
You'll be trying to move-in
You think that I'm the cure
For your body movements
Oh damn, There it goes again
Call up Christiano
When it starts to flow again
We'll take it to the floor again
Show me what you're working with
You got that yoko huh?
I got the magic stick
This ain't no magic trick
Though I'm popping rabbits
It just so happens
To be my naughty habit
Come on baby girl
Wont you come right here
I got a little secret
Can I whisper in your ear
You're so fly
And `I think that i
Should make that time
With you
With you
With you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
Every beat like a image in the background
Im sitting here, thinking where is you now
I wanna tell you but theres too many people round
You know I love you. I care but its unfair
I aint perfect but Im tryna be the best I can
If its real than its gon come back again
So Im letting go, I hope you understand
All your friends say, he dont love you
And the grown ups say its puppy
Love aint lust, Its more unlucky
Until you meet a diamond girl, now its sunny
Loving you, it was us against the World
You my favourite girl, for you I would go to war
I, take this all in just to show you
Or maybe Im just stuck in the moment
Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie & Clyde
Never had to hide like
We do
We do
You and I, both know it cant work
Its all fun and games
Til someone gets hurt
And I dont
I wont let that be you
Now you dont wanna let go
And I dont wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew
Now we dont wanna fall but
Were trippin in our hearts
And its reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you cant love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
Im still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I dont care
I got you baby
See we both
Fightin every inch of our fibers
Cuz aint no way its gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop
Now you dont wanna let go
And I dont wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew
And we dont wanna fall but
Were tripping in our hearts
And its reckless and clumsy
And I know you cant love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
Im still stuck in the moment with you
See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we cant be
Baby we both have the right to disagree
And I aint with it
And I dont wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So well never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeahhhh
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And theres nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Im still stuck in the moment with you
Yeah
Things seemed strange this morning
As I packed my bag for school
The smiles Im used to seeing just werent there
I heard my father talking
To my mother down the hallway
Above the whispers all that I could hear was
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When theres a place at your table
Theres a little hope for you and I
I was feeling kind of helpless
About the words that I just heard
Could it be the family 2 doors down?
They said a couple months of bad luck
Had them up against the wall
And though it may seem small
I know theres something I can do
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When theres a place at your table
Theres a little hope for you and I
Make room at your table for your friends and family
Take the time to share your day, just laugh, talk and eat
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at your table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When theres a place at your table
Theres a little hope for you and I
theres a little hope for you and
Its the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreadin so much cheer
I should be playin in the winter snow, but Ima be under the mistletoe
I dont wanna miss out on the holiday, but I cant stop starin at your face
I should be playin in the winter snow, but Ima be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
Everyones gatherin around the fire
Chestnuts roastin like a hot July
I should be chillin with my folks I know, but Ima be under the mistletoe
Word on the street Santas comin tonight
Reindeer flyin through the sky so high
I should be makin a list I know, but Ima be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe
Aye love, the Wisemen follow the stars, the way I follow my heart
And it lead me to a miracle, hey love
Dont you buy me nothin, cause I am feelin one thing
Your lips on my lips, thats a merry merry Christmas
Its the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreadin so much cheer
I should be playin in the winter snow, but Ima be under the mistletoe
I dont wanna miss out on the holiday, but I cant stop starin at your face
I should be playin in the winter snow, but Ima be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe yeah
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, oh yeah under the mistletoe, under the mistletoe
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe, kiss me under the mistletoe, show me baby that you love me so oh oh

Kiss me underneath the mistletoe, kiss me under the mistletoe, me baby that you love me so oh oh

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when were feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldnt be drowning on your own
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over

And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you

With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
Theres no promise that I wont keep
Ill climb a mountain, theres none too steep

Ooh, when you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey, when you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Youre overprotective when Im leaving
Tryna compromise but I cant win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, wont let this end
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First youre up, then youre down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean?

Im at a party I don't wanna be at
And I dont ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, Shall we dance? 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Dont think I fit in at this party
Everyones got so much to say 
I always feel like Im nobody
Who wants to fit in anyway?
Cause I dont care when Im with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We at a party we dont wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, Id rather kiss em right back
With all these people all around
Im crippled with anxiety
But I'm told its where Im sposed to be
You know what? Its kinda crazy cause I really dont mind
When you make it better like that
Dont think we fit in at this party
Everyones got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said Im sorry
But now I think that we should stay
Cause I dont care when Im with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Youre making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Cause I dont care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And youre making me feel like Im loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I dont like nobody but you, its like youre the only one here 
I dont like nobody but you, baby, I dont care
I dont like nobody but you, its like youre the only one here 
I dont like nobody but you, baby, yeah
Cause I dont care 
When Im with my baby, yeah

This story appeared on the June 4, 2012 cover of Forbes
Leaning on a soundboard in a Hollywood recording studio, Justin Bieber is about to make me an offer that would prompt instant hysteria among millions of American teenage girls: Do I want to be the first person outside of his inner circle to hear some rough cuts he's considering for his upcoming album, Believe?
"You've gotta hear this, it's crazy," gushes the singer. "It's called 'Die in Your Arms.'" A moment later his ubiquitous lilt surges full volume from the stadium-quality speakers, a soulful love song reminiscent of early Jackson 5. Next he plays "Happier When We're Together," a ballad in which he worries a girlfriend will be unfaithful while he's on tour. Standing up as his own beatboxing merges seamlessly with a drum machine at the beginning of "You're the One," he does an impromptu variation of the Moonwalk
One can forgive him for the victory dance. Since his debut three years ago Bieber has sold 15 million albums, grossing $150 million on 157 tour dates across two dozen countries along the way. His biopic, Never Say Never, pulled in $30 million on its opening weekend, just shy of the concert-film record, and racked up $100 million at the box office in total. His fragrance, Someday, debuted last June and did $60 million in retail sales during its first six months on the market. Those income streams helped Bieber personally earn an estimated $55 million over the past 12 months and $108 million over the past two years
"You have humans, and you have aliens," says veteran hitmaker Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley, one of the producers on Believe. "I think he's half-human and half-alien."
Even more impressive than Bieber's earning power: his vast social media reach, part of the reason he ranks third on this year's Celebrity 100 list. Bieber boasts 21 million Twitter followers--more than any person on Earth not named Lady Gaga. His 43 million Facebook fans are more than Mitt Romney's and Barack Obama's put together. With 740 million views, his breakout ballad, "Baby," is the most-watched video in YouTube history; if you assume three minutes per song, his VEVO channel's 2.4 billion impressions are enough to provide one minute of video to every person on the planet
Bieber's influence and moneymaking talents are fairly well established. It's far more surprising what he's doing with that cash. He provides a hint in the dim octagonal recording studio, owned by Rodney Jerkins, who had a hand in many of Michael Jackson's late-career hits and is now producing songs for Believe. His dancing done, Bieber quickly settles into a chair behind a keyboard. Inspiration has struck: He starts tapping out a fresh beat, as comfortable with the sophisticated equipment as a pop star a generation earlier would be strumming a rhythm guitar. "Can you loop that, what I did?" he asks the engineer at one point. Bieber eventually turns to me: "The tech aspect is just fun for me."
Bieber's tech savvy infuses more than his music--it's also a core strategy for how the entertainer intends to translate all that fame and fast money into enduring riches. Instinctively, he embraces a Peter Lynch model of investing--"I'm not going to invest in something I don't like; I have to believe in the product"--but rather than load up on buy-what-you-know value stocks, the singer has been quietly plowing millions into private tech startups. According to his manager, Bieber holds stakes in a dozen such companies. FORBES was able to verify four: messaging platform Tinychat, social-curation app Stamped, gaming outfit Sojo Studios and, most critically, Spotify, the disruptive music service founded by Daniel Ek and backed by everyone from Sean Parker to Li Ka-shing
Bieber has come a long way in the finance department since I first broached the subject with him a bit over a year ago. "I have a business manager," he told me at the 2011 Grammys. "That basically sums up the question." Today that's changed: "I do calls every week with my business manager and my lawyer," he says. "Each week I'm learning something about my business and what I need to know for my career."
Yet the core truth of last year's statement remains. Bieber is still a cocky, jokey teenager who, rightfully, thinks he has the world by the short hairs. His eye for technology and trends ultimately determines the go or no-go--and some of the investments have come through his own contacts--but the guy actively scouting deals, whether venture capital investments or brand extensions, has a nickname worthy of a teen idol's manager: Scott Braun, known to all as Scooter. "We're always looking for the next thing," he says. "If we're coming in and putting his name to something, and his brand and likeness and his social media power, then we will try and figure out a proper compensation."
The story of how Braun discovered Bieber four years ago became so immediately legendary that the latter is loath to go there. "You want me to tell you how I got started, bro?" complains Bieber, before relenting. "I really don't want to."
Bieber grew up in Stratford, Ont., a town of 30,000 two hours west of Toronto. His mother was 18 when she gave birth to her only child, and she raised him mostly by herself in state-subsidized housing. "Yellow shag carpets," he remembers, "and we had mice."
He quickly saturated those carpets with sound waves, teaching himself to play drums, trumpet, piano and guitar. At age 12 he earned second place in a local talent competition for his rendition of Ne-Yo's "So Sick." His mother posted videos of his performance on YouTube for friends who couldn't make the show; soon she was regularly uploading videos of her son covering soul songs
Around the same time, Braun was doubling as an Atlanta party promoter and a small-time music industry executive. When singer Akon asked him to research an unrelated YouTube sensation, Braun accidentally came across one of Bieber's videos--a nine-figure misclick. Astonished by the youngster's tone and range, Braun tracked down Bieber's mother and offered to fly her and her son to Atlanta to sing for him and R&B crooner Usher
"It was just crazy to me because I didn't really think that it was possible," Bieber says. "I lived in such a small town and things like that didn't really happen." Before Web 2.0 they probably never did. Yet there was Bieber, blowing away Braun and Usher in March 2008. The duo quickly signed him to their joint venture, Raymond Braun Media Group, and Braun became Bieber's manager. By September they'd landed him a record deal with Universal Music Group's Island Def Jam. His first single cracked the top 20 after its July 2009 release, and his debut EP, My World, catapulted him to mainstream fame that fall. In December President Obama invited him to sing at the White House, and he wowed a national audience with a performance on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve
This cultural phenomenon, born of social media, took a modicum of fame and tossed it into the digital echo chamber. Bieber opened a Twitter account in June 2009 and by September had amassed 1 million followers. He was also an early adopter of Instagram, the photo-sharing service recently purchased by Facebook for $1 billion, and boasts 1.5 million followers there, more than any other user 
"It used to be there was a mystery to the artist," says Bieber. "Now there's, like, no mystery--the fans want the connection, they want to see you Instagramming at a coffee shop in the morning."
With such social media dexterity Bieber has built himself a formidable platform. The 30-year-old Braun's challenge: sustaining the phenomenon. In many ways Bieber and Braun are the most intriguing talent-manager combo since Elvis and Colonel Tom Parker. Both managers wielded the influence that comes from discovering their charges young, and both faced the challenge of moving them past the fickle market of hysterical, screaming teenage girls
But whereas Parker took any deal he could and up to 50% of the action to make sure his once-in-a-lifetime meal ticket turned into a decades-long feast, Braun is more judicious. His deal with Bieber is closer to the standard 15%; he thinks long-term success requires selectivity, not ubiquity, and aligning all deals with Bieber's brand. "I don't let him get involved in anything unless he likes it," he says. Turning Bieber into the world's most unconventional venture capitalist is simply a sophisticated manifestation of that philosophy
All you gotta do is just be there
Pray for a miracle
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
And now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and fuck yourself
Ive been runnin' through the jungle
Ive been runnin with the wolves to get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you, to get to you
I was wonderin bout your momma
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sold that car that gave her problems?
I m just curious bout her, honest
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, that night
Lost in a feeling along with the stars in the sky
So Im wondering, can we still be friends?
Can we still be friends?
Doesnt have to end
And if it ends, can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Im holdin' on, I'm paper thin
This loves a game, you always win
And blindly I am followin
Break down these walls and come on in
You've been wonderin why Ive been callin
Like I got ulterior motives
I know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had somethin so good, oh
Ive been runnin through the jungle
Ive been runnin with the wolves to get to you
To get to you
Ive been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you
Ive looked for love in every stranger
Did too much to ease the anger all for you
Yeah, all for you
All to get to you
Oh, oh, oh, to get to you
I gave you the key when the door wasnt open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now Im all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you? Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya? Couldnt find you anywhere
When you broke down I didnt leave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin? To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin, thats for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin, oh Lord
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the I need you, I need you the I need you, I need you, where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the I need you, I need you, I need you the most

You gotta go and get angry with all of my honesty
You know I try but I dont do too well with apologies
I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Im sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Ill take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
Ill go, Ill go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im not just trying to get you back on me
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry
Im sorry, yeah
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry
Im sorry, yeah
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?

My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...
Oh yeah yeah dont get any better
Oh yeah yeah wish that this was forever
Your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling
And its a celebration
Feels like a celebration
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling down, down, down
All this talk about being in love
I could never get into the party
Never really understood what it was
Like whats the big deal anyway?
Oh, but I decided I should give it a try
The very moment that you gave me the invite
Ive never seen anything like it before
Once you open the door
See I was like...
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought youd always be mine 
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought youd always be mine 
Im gone 
Now Im all gone 
Now Im all gone 
Now Im all gone 
Im gone
Your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling down, down, down

For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying, on my own well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinkin I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ive been movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back, baby you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats goin on
And now I know, I should be sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinkin I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ive been movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back, baby you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats goin on
And now I know, I should be sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Da-da da-da, da-da da
Da-da da-da, da-da da
Da-da da-da, da-da, da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da, da-da da
Da-da da-da, da-da da
Da-da da-da, da-da da-da da
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Im at a party I dont wanna be at
And I dont ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin if I could sneak out the back
Nobodys even lookin me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, Shall we dance? 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Dont think I fit in at this party
Everyones got so much to say 
I always feel like Im nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
Cause I dont care when Im with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And youre making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Cause I dont care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And youre making me feel like Im loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We at a party we dont wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we cant hear ourselves
Read your lips, Id rather kiss em right back
With all these people all around
Im crippled by anxiety
But Im told its where Im sposed to be
You know what? Its kinda crazy cause I really dont mind
When you make it better like that
Dont think we fit in at this party
Everyones got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said Im sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay
Cause I dont care when Im with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, youre making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Cause I dont care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And youre making me feel like Im loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
I dont like nobody but you, its like youre the only one here
I dont like nobody but you, baby, I dont care
I dont like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I dont like nobody but you, baby, yeah
Cause I dont care 
When Im with my baby, yeah 
All the bad things disappear 
And youre making me feel like maybe I am somebody 
I can deal with the bad nights 
When Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Cause I dont care as long as you just hold me near 
You can take me anywhere 
And youre making me feel like Im loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When Im with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Come, they told me
Pa rum pa pum pum
A newborn king to see
Pa rum pa pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum pa pum pum
To lay before the king
Pa rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pa pum
Rum pa pum pum pum pum
Yeah Im on the drum
Yeah Im on the snare drum
Yeah Im on the beat
Cos the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat
Cos Im playin for the son
Playin for the king
Playin for the title
Its Christmas time, time to read your
Holy Bible
Im so tight, I might go pyscho
Christmas time, so heres a recital
Im so bad like Michael
I know Im still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid love like cupid
Im the drummer boy so do it, do it
Little baby, pa rum pa pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pum pum
I have no gifts to bring
Pa rum pa pum pum
Thats fit to give our king
Pa rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum
At the table with the family, havin dinner
Blackberry on our hip
And then it gave a little flicker
So I took a look to see it
Before it activates the ringer
Came home to realize
My homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
So I hit him back despite
I had some food up on my finger
Sippin eggnogg with a little sprinkle of
Vanilla
Even though its kinda cold
Pullin out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said
Lets make it hot up in the winter
I said Cool ya know Imma deliver
Lets collaborate and
Make the holidays a little bigger
Before we work, gotta get this off
See them other family members
And drop gifts off
Then we headed to the studio
Cos aint nothing stopping us
You know we bout to turn it up
And really get it poppin now
To people everywhere and all our
Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time
Pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him
Pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him
Pa rum pa pum pum
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum
If you wanna give
Its the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah yeah Im on the snare
Its crazy how some people
Say, say they dont care
When theres people on the street
With no food, its not fair
Its about time for you to act merrilly
Its about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
Cos they warm by the fire
Getting toys and their dolls
Not thinking theres a family out
Hungry and cold
Wishin, wishin that they had somebody
They could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, lets change the globe
Im the drummer boy so drum, drum
Im the drummer boy so drum, drum
Im the drummer boy so drum, drum
Im the drummer boy so drum, drum
Im the drummer boy so drum, drum

Everybody gets high sometimes you know
What else can we do when were feeling low 
So take a deep breath and let it go 
You shouldnt be drowning on your own
And if you feel youre sinking I will jump right over into
Cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places I will
Still be patient with you
I was wonderin bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
Im just curious bout her, honest
Know youre wonderin why I been callin
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didnt end this so good
But you know we had something so good
So Im wonderin
Can we still be friends?
Can we still be friends?
Doesnt have to end
And if it ends, can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Wonderin if you got a body
To hold you tighter since I left
Wonderin if you think about me

So many things that are on my mind
Cant wait to get you all alone

Hey girl, do I feel like everything in my life

I think I love you more than I love me 
You say you love me more, is that right?

If you appreciate the man that I am
And not remind me the things that I aint
I cant just stand around and be fake 
Cause of the type of people we hate 
Its a private estate, you wrapped around my heart
Cant believe I let you walk through these gates
Love seein your tattoos and your toes out

When it comes to you, dont be blind

Boy was I in for a big surprise
With no doubt looking round
Thinking that Im so cool
Same place same time every day of my life
Could we meet after school
Finally if I didnt make him cry
He wouldnt be with another girl
Nothing can cure my
Headache cause Im experiencing
What they call heartbreak
Its going to hurt worse
As long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I cant shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say its only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here
Now Im all tore up taking back when I was at your door
The first time when you said forever Ill be yours
Started walking your hand in my hand feelings got stronger
We made a promise
And whenever I leave it feels like your still with me
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I gotta get out of here
What am I to do when I look up and your not there
Nothing can cure my headache
Cause Im experiencing what they call heartbreak
Its going to hurt worse as long as I stay here 
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something I cant shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say its only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here
Say Im too young for love
I got so much life to live ahead
But, if only this is love I could get over
I know I have to deal with the pain
Nothing can Cure my headache
Cause Im experiencing what they call heartbreak
Its going to hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I cant shake 
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say its only just as worse as you make it 
I know but man just let me lay here

You keep playin games with me thats not coasta
Instead of blessin me now like you supposed ta
You take me aboard love roller coasta
Trying to get off when your on like Oprah girl

And I dont know why
Im addicted 
Something like an addict
Got me twisted 
But still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive

Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
Whats your nationality? I wonder if theres more of you
Shes got my attention, shes confident

Something like an addict 
Got me twisted 
But still I gotta have it
Chance? The Rapper? IGH!
Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk 
She aint got a heart or a ass, just her brains
Gotta ask cause her ass on a learning curve 
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
Thats only legal with a doctors note 
Real deep pockets like a doctors coat 
Stay faded like Diddys hair, back tryna rock the vote
She the first mate when I rock the boat 
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll 
She say I know, honey bunny, thats the funny thing 
Thots twerk for the Goodfellas

Shes confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, shes confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and Im down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, shes confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said its her first time 
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn 
And I dont know why
Im addicted 
Something like an addict
Got me twisted 
But still I gotta have it
Still I gotta have it 
Still I gotta have it 
Still I gotta have it 
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no 
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no

Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
But still I gotta have it
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when were feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldnt be drowning on your own
And if you feel youre sinking
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
I wont let go
And I hope you know
I wont let go
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when were feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldnt be drowning on your own
And if you feel youre sinking
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
I wont let go
And I hope you know
I wont let go
You aint gotta answer none of my calls
Im believing youll pick up one day
I dont wanna add to your pain at all
Im praying that time makes a change in your life
Im realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I dont wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Dont nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what Im saying is
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
No rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
No rush, no pressure
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought Id take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin it, Im so delirious
And Im a put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no one else
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
Im the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
No rush, no pressure
You aint gotta make your mind up
You aint gotta make your mind up right now
No rush, no pressure
Oh, no
No limit in the sky
That I wont fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I wont cry for ya, oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
Theres no promise that I wont keep
Ill climb a mountain, theres none too steep
When it comes to you, theres no crime
Lets take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, dont be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Hey, hey 
Hey, hey 
Hey, hey 
Hey, hey
Comes, comes, comes, comes to you
Cupid aint a lie
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Dont miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Aint gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, its yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh
When it comes to you, theres no crime
Lets take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, dont be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Hey, hey, hey 
Hey, hey 
Hey, hey 
Hey, hey
Comes, comes, comes, comes to you
When it comes to you
Its easy to get frustrated
When you got no answers
Its easy to get overwhelmed
Make you wanna put the blame on somebody else
I can sympathize with ya
Yeah, I will always ride with ya
Ill be the one to cry with ya
You can lay it on me, I wont leave you lonely
No, no-no-no-no-no-no

You can lay it on me, I wont leave you lonely
I can see youre in your head again
No, I cant stand to see you when youre strugglin
Yeah, you need a little motivation
Remember, life is a celebration
Bad thoughts that cross for no perspective
And Lord knows I need some good direction
Maybe this time is of the essence
You can lay it on me, I wont leave you lonely
No, no-no-no-no-no-no
You can lay it on me, I wont leave you lonely
Lo-onely, no-oh, no-oh, no-oh
You can lay it on me, I wont leave you lonely

You think Im crying on my own. Well, I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care. I dont
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job
Didnt see whats going on
But now I know
Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself...
...INSTRUMENTAL...
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself...
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
I dont know if youre happy or complaining
Dont want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, making love all night
First youre up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know know know...
What do you mean? Wooaah
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Oh what do you mean?
When you dont want me to go
But you tell me to leave
What do you mean?

Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Hmm, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
Duh
White shirt now red, my bloody nose 
Sleepin, youre on your tippy toes 
Creepin around like no one knows 
Think youre so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you 
Dont say thank you or please 
I do what I want when Im wanting to 
My soul so cynical
So Im a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just cant get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
Yeah, Shes that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
Im the bad guy 
[Post-Chorus
Ooo
Ooo
Ooo 
Ooo 
Yeah
Yeah
Gold teeth, my neck, my wrist is froze 
I got more ice than, than the snow 
That guy, dont act like you dont know 
That guy, so critical 
Tattoos on both my sleeves
Yeah, I dont sleep, please dont wake me
Loosen my tie up so I can breathe
It aint political, oh no
Yeah, Im a bad guy
Aint no holdin back guy
Come off like Im mad guy
Always got your back guy
Yeah, Im the real type
Keep you full of thrills type
Show you what it feels like
Got an open invite
Im the bad-bad guy 
Ooo
Ooo
Ooo, Im the bad guy
Ooo, Ahh, Ahh 
Im the bad guy
Oh, oh ohhh oh 
I just cant sleep tonight
Knowing that things aint right
Its in the papers, its on the TV, its everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people dont have a home
But I know theres sunshine beyond that rain
I know theres good times behind that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I lose my appetite, knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner cause half my dinner is still there on my plate?
Oh, I got a vision to make a difference
And its starting today
Cause I know theres sunshine beyond that rain
I know theres good times behind that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change?
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and I pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls that need a break
Can you give em one today?
I just cant sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and I pray 
I pray
I pray
I close my eyes and pray
Everybody gets sad sometimes, you know

Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
Im all alone
And I hope someones gonna help me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul 
I need to know you wont let go
I wont let go, no no, no no no no
Ill be your lifeline tonight
You wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
I wont let go
I wont let go
What if I, what if I?
What if I, what if I?
You put me on a pedestal and tell me Im the best
Raise me up into the sky until Im short of breath, mm-mm
Fill me up with confidence, I say whats in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until theres nothin left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest
But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know, mm-mm
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
Big dreams of doin shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryna act cool, upset by their jealousy
Theyre liftin me up, liftin me up
Had a chip on my shoulder, had to let it go
Cause unforgiveness keeps them in control
I came in with good intentions, then I let it go
And now I really wanna know
What if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall? 
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
Yeah, what if I, what if I sin? 
And what if I, what if I break? 
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know, yeah-yeah-yeah
La-da-da-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da-da-da, da-da 
La-da-da-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da-da-da, da-da
What if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
What if I, what if I sin? 
And what if I, what if I break? 
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know, oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da-da-da, da-da 
La-da-da-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da-da-da, da-da

Hey!

Im f-f-f-falling up
Just f-f-f-falling up
Im f-f-f-falling up
Just f-f-f-falling up 
Made fans, made music
Catch your heir but I hope I dont lose it
People tryna steal my song, yeah and use it
Know I had to go hard and prove it
Ah, but Im here to make minds
Im gon stay, yeah, Im almost signed
Just got to stick, stick with the grind
Kind of seems that Im making somethin shine, ahh
Never gonna give up on yall
Im almost there, yeah I got so far
Fans I love all of yall

Feel like Im falling up
Falling up, falling up
Feel like Im falling up
Feel like Im falling up
Feel like Im falling up
Falling up, falling up

Many times got tough, and times got hard
Fans, fans brought me up
Supporters, brought me to the stars
Sayin got to keep it one hundred percent
All this money I earn, all this money I spent
On this music thing, hope it makes me rich
Cause I dont want to spend my time wasting it

Almost there, yeah I got so far
Fans I love all of yall

Youre overprotective when I'm leaving
Tryna compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, wont let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then youre down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know...
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you dont want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said youre running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Don't be so selfish baby, yeah

Oh, what do you mean now? Hey-ey
Oh, oh tudurudururu
Oh, oh, hey, yeah yeah
What do you mean?
I am A Rapper, thats all of my life since I was a kid and flying them kites. I dont got time. They want a reaction but they aint getting one. I got something for you son. I got something to give, and they got something to take. The three victims of it, Me Justin and Blake. I mean we got something to return. You got misdirected so you better relearn. Oh No, I am not done. I am not broken. This is the life this is the token
They cant take whats mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Oooo I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping
Whooaa 
Whooaa 
Im way too strong for that
Know you were wrong for that
So keep on chasing that 458, As I cruise on the smooth high way
I aint even tryna get away, Im good
Tryna break me
Ooooh I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken
Oooo I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken
They cant take whats mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Oooo I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping
Hoping and praying I really wont make it
All of these things they tried to forsake me
How you gon play me, how you gon break me. Ive been in this ish since diapers and babies
All of my life, been driving em crazy, there go the Blakie, thoght of them ladies
Dreamin of Benz, and kissing Mercedes, living the life and acting so crazy
Hidin from cameras, hidin the ladies
How do you expect me not to go crazy
Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends the moneys still gravy
Whishin on stars thats why they still hatin
Money out front, we never be waiting
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient
Its a cold world that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant
They cant tell Satan whats in it, and they pray for me to be finished
Haters gonna start trippin, when you dont pay them no attention
Then the obstacles that I face
I guarantee that I kill it
Ah!
Oooo I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken
 No
Oooo I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken
They cant take whats mine
Someone like me thats hard to find
Oooo I cannot be broken
I cannot...
Girl I want - Chris Brown ft Justin Bieber
Verse 1
Remember when we were young
We dreamt about getting older
Driving vintage cars
I wanted you to give me your heart
And then you said I do
But i was holding you tight
Oooh tonight is not a dream
Pre Chorus
And i want your love
Inside my head with your signature
And you are the girl i want
You are the one thing that sends me drifting through the sky
Chorus
Every time that you fall in my arms
You the one thing that triggers my heart
Take me to the stars
Up up and away
It dont matter how far
Wherever you are
There is nothing that can pull us apart
We can travel to Mars
Up up and away
Verse 2
Remember we would sit and stare
At the sun going down and the stars are shining
We aint gotta make believe
Because you really love me
So imma give you everything i got
Pre Chorus
And i want your love
Inside my head with your signature
And you are the girl i want
You are the one thing that sends me drifting through the sky
Chorus
Every time that you fall in my arms
You the one thing that triggers my heart
Take me to the stars
Up up and away
It dont matter how far
Wherever you are
There is nothing that can pull us apart
We can travel to Mars
Up up and away
Every time that you fall in my arms
You the one thing that triggers my heart
Take me to the stars
Up up and away
It dont matter how far
Wherever you are
There is nothing that can pull us apart
We can travel to Mars
Up up and away
Come and move that in my direction
So thankful for that, its such a blessin, yeah
Turn every situation into Heaven, yeah
Oh, you are my sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin some kind of way
Make me wanna savour every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love, how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear
The only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long
Oh, tu, tu eres el iman y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso
Oh, yeah ya, ya me esta gustando mas de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo mas
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningun apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estas conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le ensenes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
Dejame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido
Si te pido un beso, ven, damelo
Yo se que estas pensandolo
Llevo tiempo intentandolo
Mami, esto es dando y dandolo
Sabes que tu corazon conmigo te hace bang-bang
Sabes que esa beba esta buscando de mi bang-bang
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver como te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuanto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, despues salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tu me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa montarlo aqui tengo la pieza
!Oye!
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estas conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le ensenes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
Dejame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito
Bitch I wasnt even born in Puerto Rico
Yo soy Cubano y te lo meto rico
Call it nueva onda
This is Metal-cito
!Bailalo!
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le ensenes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when were feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldnt be drowning on your own
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I wont let go
I wont let go
Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
Its how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you til Im old
You shouldnt be fighting on your own
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know...
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
Ill be your lifeline tonight

Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in

Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know its a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
Ill be your platinum, Ill be your silver, Ill be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
Ill be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for the change girl
You can be my Destinys Child on a stinger
So dont stress, dont cry, we dont need no wings to fly
Just take my hand
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
Ill be your platinum, Ill be your silver, Ill be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
I dont know if this makes sense, but youre my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, and Ill rendezvous, and Ill fly you to it
Ill beat ya there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust...
A couple of things I cant spell without you
Now we are on top of the world, cause thats just how we do
Used to tell me skys the limit, now the skys is our point of view
Man now we stepping out like wow 
Cameras pointed shoot
Ask me whats my best side, I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered
But the grass aint always greener on the other side
Its green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true true true
But Id rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me
As you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
Ill be your platinum, Ill be your silver, Ill be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love me
I hear a lot about sinners
Dont think that Ill be a saint
But I might go down to the river, uh
Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, its makin me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I dont do well with the drama
And no, I cant stand it bein fake
No, no, no, no, no, no-no-no
I dont believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I cant explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say were too young and
The pimps and the players say, Dont go crushin
Wise men say, Fools rush in
But I dont know 
They say were too young and
The pimps and the players say, Dont go crushin
Wise men say, Fools rush in
But I dont know 
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
Im a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they dont see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty, like Lionel Messi
Lets take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a jet-ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you
Brides groom, Im my fathers child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Fathers proud
If you make it to the water Hell part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion He can trust
I know I aint leavin you like I know He aint leavin us
I know we believe in God and I know God believes in us
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
On God
Runnin to the altar like a track star
Cant wait another second
Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I used to believe
We were burnin on the edge of somethin beautiful
Somethin beautiful
Sellin a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, its been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you 
Let me love you
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you 
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby
Dont fall asleep
At the wheel, weve got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know were good enough yeah
Know were good enough
Say go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh its been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you 
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby
Everybody gets high sometimes you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breathe and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
And if you feel you're sinking
I would jump right over into cold cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I would still be patient with you
I want you to know
I won't let go
I'll be your life tonight, oh woah
I'll be your life tonight
Teri dila di galabatan
Lar lar kay aavein mere kol
I wanna lay with you 'till I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own
Je tenu lagda hai, tu paani vich duub jaave
Main jaan day khe, bachavan ga
Har pal sanu bhool jaavein, purani gaalan yaad na avein
Phir vi tenu inna pyar mein karaanga
I want you to know
I won't let go
I'll be your life tonight, oh woah
I'll be your life tonight
Come on, come on
I'll save you from a rocking boat
Baby just stay afloat
You're not alone
Holi, holi, holi, holi dube
Holi, holi, holi, holi dube
Holi, holi, holi, holi dube tuu
But I won't let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
Ill be your lifeline tonight
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but, you still hit my phone up
And baby Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When shes around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
Youre the smile on my face, and I aint going nowhere
Im here to make you happy, Im here to see you smile
Ive been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Whats gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall
Well, I can tell youre afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you dont wanna lose
Well I dont wanna lose it either
And I dont think I can stand sitting around while youre hurting babe, so take my hand
Well, did you know youre an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone, every time you done wrong, Im the shoulder youre crying on
And I hope by the time that Im done with this song Ill have figured out
Whats gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all, oh, my love 
But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you cant fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Whats gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all, oh, my love 
But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall
Whats gonna make you fall in love? 
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all 
Oh, my love
But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you cant fly unless you listen, let yourself fall
Justin Bieber 
Sometimes its hard to do the right thing
When the pressures coming down like lightning Its like they want me to be perfect
When they dont even know that Im hurting

Theres one thing that I know for sure

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
You said "I come in peace" so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythms on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone
You don't know what they're like, if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
Listen, listen
Don't try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting, I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
Before you came around, I was in a rut
Didn't have a friend, didn't know what it was
You taught how to dream and how to love
You're my best friend please listen to me
You don't know what they're like, if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
Listen, listen
Don't try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting, I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
Uh
Greetings, I fell from the sky
I'm from a different world I use JO as a disguise
My flying saucer crashed, I'm the only one that survived
I've only taking over this planet since I arrived
I'm in a backpack, I'm ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they tryna capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
John's world
You don't know what they're like, if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
Listen, listen
Don't try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting, I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
Sitting here just thinking about nothing
Trying to gather my thoughts
Over and over Im thinking about all we have lost
All about you, you
It's all about you, you
All about you, you
It's not about me, yeah
It's all about you
Its not about what Ive done
It's all about what you did
All about what did to me
You did for me
You gave me life and life abundantly,
Took all my struggles for more than me
Thats what you did
Im amazed by you
Its not about my past, Its not my future
Its about the present, Its right now

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin

And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small

Now that I give to you all of me, oh
When it comes to you, theres no crime
Lets take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, dont be blind
Watch me speak from my heart

They told me casual affection leads to--
But its hard to get when youre so used to rejection
Yeah, the teacher loved the preacher
But then he had to leave her
Had to wash away the sins of a male cheerleader
Hi, nice to meet ya, got nothing to believe in
So let me know when my breathing stops
Cause my high hopes are getting low
Because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried, I would never know
My high hopes are getting low

Because I get the feeling that Im gonna get 
Tick, tock, stop the clock

I miss you
Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and were upside down
I know its hard, babe, to sleep at night
Dont you worry
Cause everythings gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Dont you worry
Cause everythings gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Dont you worry
Cause everythings gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

All alone, in my room..
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart
Oh I
Oh I
Love you
And everythings gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
You know that I care for you
Ill always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah

!Oh! Tu, tu eres el iman y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso 
Ya, ya me esta gustando mas de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo mas
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningun apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estas conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le ensenes a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos 
Dejame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido
Si te pido un beso, ven, damelo, yo se que estas pensandolo
Llevo tiempo intentandolo, mami, esto es dando y dandolo
Sabes que tu corazon conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba esta buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver como te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuanto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, despues salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tu me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa montarlo aqui tengo la pieza
!Oye!
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oido
Para que te acuerdes si no estas conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le ensenes a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos 
Dejame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, !Ay, Bendito!
I can move forever cuando este contigo
!Bailalo!
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le ensenes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido 
Despacito

Je breekt mijn hart maar ik wil je niet laten gaan

Voor, voor, voor jou, ik doe alles voor jou
Niet te geloven want nu sta ik in de kou
Ik denk ik blijf cool, maar als ik jou verlies
Dan blijf je toch altijd een meisje dat ik kies
Ik ben gebroken, kom doe gewoon
En schud me wakker uit die vreselijke rotdroom
Het doet zon pijn, pijn, pijn, pijn
En ik kan niet geloven dat jij er niet zal zijn
En ik denk
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, jij
Ik dacht jij blijft altijd bij mij
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, jij
Ik dacht jij blijft altijd bij mij 
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, I skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows shes got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying
En ik denk
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, jij
Ik dacht jij blijft altijd bij mij
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, jij
Ik dacht jij blijft altijd bij mij 
Het is gedaan
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Het is gedaan
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Het is gedaan
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Het is gedaan 
Ik blijf alleen
Justin Bieber - Changes 
By: Andrew S.
3/21/20
	Almost two weeks ago, , singer not-songwriter Justin Bieber released his sixth original studio album. It was very bad, and it's hard to say much about it. While making quite a few atrocious pieces of "music" as a younger child, there were a few songs that are now considered pop classics from his last album Purpose. I agree with this; while wildly overplayed, his hit single "Love Yourself" was quite a decent song to its core. There's no questioning the fact that Justin Bieber is a horrible, horrible man, but I feel like if he pulled it together a little bit, he'd have the ability to whip up a genuinely good record. He hyped this record up recently before the release of its main single "Yummy". He claimed he'd gone on a "spiritual journey" for the past five years in his hiatus of making music, and was ready to put out his best album yet; a truly great masterpiece. Though, as one may expect after hearing a single song from this burning pile of garbage, it is not at all a masterpiece. It has no charm, and could easily be considered his worst album yet. In my opinion, it certainly is. All of his older childhood albums had a certain feel to them of just this kid being stupid and used for his lack of musical ability, but his songs had a certain nostalgia to them. Or at least they do now. While that may seem like the album would sound bad, the albums did emerge as child-star classics. This album, though, is an overproduced, terribly-written piece of garbage, with not one, but ZERO good songs on the entire thing. I gave Selena Gomez's latest album "Rare" a 1.5 out of 10 because "Lose You To Love Me" is a genuinely good song. Though, there isn't one good song on this entire thing. If I had to choose a favorite track, it would be "E.T.A.", because the guitar riff isn't terrible, and the lyrics and vocals in general aren't too annoying or aggravating. That being said, if I could, I'd say my least favorite tracks are EVERYTHING ELSE.

We were inseparable
Everything I had to do I did it next to you
And the memories we made were so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule
There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know Im responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby
You got used to
Being alone, alone
You adapted, now youre used to
Being alone, all alone
OO you got used to being on your own
I saw it happening
But I didnt accept the truth, I couldnt fathom it
There was so much going on you couldnt handle it
Could have divided my time, I should have fractioned it
But there was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know Im responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby
You got used to
Being alone, alone, 
You adapted , now your use to
Being alone, all alone 
OO you got used too being on your own
Lyrics
Thinkin bout you, it aint always bout me
Dont make any sense in you bein lonely
Hurry up and get here now, but dont speed
Ill never get over you up under me
Im available
Oh, yes, I am
Im available
Yeah, for you, I am
Dont mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say Im number one on your to-do list
Im available 
Im available
You stick out of the crowd, baby, its a no-brainer
It aint that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, its a no-brainer
You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise
One nightll change your whole life
Off top, drop-top, baby its a no-brainer
Put em up if you with me

Happy birthday
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
Lips wont let me go, lips wont let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
Dont let this go to your head
But youre the best Ive ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
Lips wont let me go, lips wont let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where Id rather be instead
You dont know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just wont stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
Lips wont let me go, lips wont let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
Im a fan and youre the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause youre too bad for me
Shot that arrow Im hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So dont mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So dont mind if I turn away, ooh
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
Lips wont let me go, lips wont let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips wont let me go
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think Im cryin on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Girl you dont know how I feel
Since you been away oh baby
Cant sleep
2 AM, staring at the ceiling
Doin nothing but reflecting on feelings
And everything that life has to offer
Feel like a piece gold in a sea of copper
Thatll be forgotten once Im put inside a coffin
Wish the local night clubs were open more often
At least then, Ill have something to do
When my nights alone start to turn blue
Maybe I just think too deep
Still wide awake while everyone is asleep
My futures unclear, Im so nearsighted
Parties up town, I wish I was invited
I could blaze like its 4/20 quick
But the very thought of smoking makes me sick
Bad thoughts in the dark, like a backdrop
My bedroom lit up by the glow of my laptop
I find myself awake again
Sitting up in bed, thoughts in my brain
Weighing heavy on my mind
Till I fall asleep and the dawn arrives
I wonder what my friends are up to?
If they were in my shoes, what would they do?
Probably call up their friends
And go out until the night life ends
And when I see them party so heavily
I wish I could delete my jealousy
We only live once man, thats the motto
I wish with them, I was there also
But maybe what I need is a breather
I could say I Dont Care, Sheeran and Bieber
But even I know deep down that isnt true
So I sit alone, actin like Im not missin you
Am I wasting my time doing so?
Acting like Im okay, when my spirits broke?
When it comes to joy, I swear Im on a hunt
cause this sort of life I dont really want
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum

Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And youre all that I can see

One more time fore I go
Body lockin, put a hold on me
You know, I like that youre wild
So make your way over here right now

Celebrate life with me babe
Dont be in a rush to go now
Oh, girl

One more time fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance

Oh
Well, let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When shes around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
Youre the smile on my face, and I aint going nowhere
Im here to make you happy, Im here to see you smile
But Ive been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Whats gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall
Well, I can tell youre afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you dont wanna lose
Well, I dont wanna lose it either
But I dont think I can stand sitting around while youre hurting babe, so take my hand
Well, did you know youre an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of yous gone, every time you done wrong, Im the shoulder youre crying on
And I hope by the time that Im done with this song Ill have figured out
Whats gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you cant fly unless you let your, you cant fly unless you let yourself fall

Justin Beiber:

Melly Hikachi:
Hi I'm gentlemen

And how you star in an orbit space
Done with the classy act cause
Girl you look good gon back ass up
Justin Beiber:
I got my peaches out in Georgia 
I get my weed from California 
I took my chick up to the North, yeah 
I get my light right from the source, yeah
You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
Youre pulling me
You're pulling me in like youre gravity
Im notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Im trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Cant get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe Im crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least thats what it seems
Could it be I dont know whats good for me?
Im notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Cant get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Im sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
Im standing on the borderline
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Im trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe Im crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
You are to me

Oh, oh, whoa, whoa

But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe Im crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I dont do too well with apologies
I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Ill take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
Ill go, Ill go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im not just trying to get you back on me
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Move your body girl to the beat now
Move your body girl to the beat now
Hey girl pull up move your body

All emotions get ignored
But Im sufferin, Im only human
Yeah, what if you had it all
Skipped town just to restart
Maybe then youd know me
When all was said and done
I didnt have anyone
And thats just fuckin lonely
Im so lo-o-o-onely

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I used to believe
We were burnin on the edge of somethin beautiful
Somethin beautiful
Sellin a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, its been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you

At the wheel, weve got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know were good enough yeah

Say go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down

Let me love you
Let me love you
Dont you give up, nah, nah, nah
I wont give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
Its like youre stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it aint over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesnt mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, its just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But its strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it aint ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesnt mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Life is worth living again
Believe in yourself, or you will never succeed
[Plays sample of Justin Biebers Believe}
Mu-Mu-Mu-Murda
Tell me why I get this feeling
That you really wanna turn me on
Tell me why I get this feeling
That you really wanna make me yours, ah

To see if Im gon' be the one thats in your arms

So tell me, whats your motive?

Ima fly away with ya tonight
'Cause you see me tryin, subliminally tryin
To see if youll be the one in my arms
Well I can admit that it's tirin, but at times its excitin
But before you lead me on

I bought a castle in France
And its the same one I built in the sand for you
When I was two
I thought I painted a picture of heaven
But it turns out its just your room, just your room
Id run off the end of the earth just to see if youd catch me
When I know youd let me fall every time
Is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my-
 is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way I need to be loved by you

You know my lovin is a everyday ting, baby
And when we in different places

I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you 
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I dont do too well with apologies
I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Can we both say the words and forget this
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
You're so indecisive, what I'm saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Dont know if youre happy or complaining
Dont want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First youre up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know...
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said youre running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You want to make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, wont let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First youre up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really want to know...
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean? 
Said youre running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
No limit in the sky
That I wont fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I wont cry for ya, oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
Theres no promise that I wont keep
Ill climb a mountain, theres none too steep
When it comes to you, theres no crime
Lets take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, dont be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you, comes to you
Comes to you
Want you to share that
When it comes to you
Cupid aint a lie
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Dont miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Aint gotta live life without me instead
Share my life, its yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh
When it comes to you, theres no crime
Lets take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, dont be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you, comes to you
Want you to share
When it comes to you
When it comes to you, theres no crime
Lets take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, dont be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you, comes to you
Maybe I stare too much
Maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair
Dancin like no ones there
I know Im where Im supposed to be
I say I love you under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your heads layin right on my chest
Suns up and I still aint got no rest
Dont wanna close my eyes, Im scared Ill miss too much
Dont wanna fall asleep, Id rather fall in love
When I cant feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without yous like two months
Dont wanna close my eyes, Im scared Ill miss too much
Dont wanna fall asleep, Id rather fall in love
Cause eternity with you aint long enough
Two seconds without yous like two months
And thats too much
Love the way you love your mom
Take on all your friends problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh
I still relive that second
I met my biggest blessing
Prayed for you, look what God has done
I say I love you under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your heads layin right on my chest
Suns up and I still aint got no rest
Dont wanna close my eyes, Im scared Ill miss too much
Dont wanna fall asleep, Id rather fall in love
When I cant feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without yous like two months
Dont wanna close my eyes, Im scared Ill miss too much
Dont wanna fall asleep, Id rather fall in love
Cause eternity with you aint long enough
Two seconds without yous like two months
And thats too much
Yeah , Yeah , Yeah

Never let you go, never let me down

Se dejo
Del odio y no quiere saber de nadie 
Y se canso, oh-oh
Dicen que ya no es la misma de antes
Janguea solita y a su novio lo dejo, oh-oh
Se canso, oh-oh
Dicen que ya no es la misma de antes
Janguea solita y a su novio lo dejo, oh-oh
Lo bloqueo, su numero cambio
Ahora sale pa la calle y lo da to, oh-oh
Desde que llego de Colombia con el cuerpito operado
Y se dejo de aquel, detra lo que tiene es un ganado
Dice que no habla con nadie pero siempre esta ocupado
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think Im cryin on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Said if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when were feelin low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldnt be drowning on your own
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know...
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
Its how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you til Im old, o-old
You shouldnt be fighting on your own
And if you feel youre sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know...
I wont let go
And I wont let go, no-no, no-no, no I wont
Ill be your lifeline tonight
I wont let go
Ill be your lifeline tonight
Do you love the rain, does it make you dance
When youre gone with your friends at a party?
Whats your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?
When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin?
Everything, I wanna know it all
Id spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if thats what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but Im gonna try
If its ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
Im gonna love you 
Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now, do you think of me?
When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin?
Everything, I wanna know it all
Id spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if thats what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but Im gonna try
If its ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
Im gonna love you 
Ooh, want the good and the bad and everything in between
Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity
Ooh, yeah
Id spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if thats what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but Im gonna try 
If its ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
Im gonna love you 
And I...
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I dont do too well with apologies
I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Im sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
Ill take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
Ill go, Ill go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause Im missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows shes got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no

So that I can be the best for you

Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Je zegt ik wil je, mijn nummer een
Wanneer je mij roept, kom ik meteen
Je wilt mijn liefde, ik wil jouw hart
Wij horen samen en nooit meer, nooit meer apart
Zijn wij een koppel? Wat stel je voor?
Alleen maar vrienden? Ik heb je door
Is er een ander? Kijk me toch aan
Je breekt mijn hart maar ik wil je niet laten gaan
En ik denk
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, jij
Ik dacht jij blijft altijd bij mij
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, jij
Ik dacht jij blijft altijd bij mij 
Voor, voor, voor jou, ik doe alles voor jou
Niet te geloven want nu sta ik in de kou
Ik denk ik blijf cool, maar als ik jou verlies
Dan blijf je toch altijd een meisje dat ik kies
Ik ben gebroken, kom doe gewoon
En schud me wakker uit die vreselijke rotdroom
Het doet zon pijn, pijn, pijn, pijn
En ik kan niet geloven dat jij er niet zal zijn
En ik denk
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, ooh
Baby baby baby, jij
Ik dacht jij blijft altijd bij mij
Baby baby baby, ooh

On this perc under the mistletoe
I dont wanna miss out on the holiday
But Im blacked out, on my face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But Im fucked up in Mexico
With you, shawty with you 
Under the mistletoe
Everyones gotta smoke on this fire

On this perc under the mistletoe
Super fucked up 
But I still do my shit when Im high
I should be chilling with my bitch, I know
On this perc, high in Mexico

Lyrics from Snippet
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you Id change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I cant find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, yeah, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you Id change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I cant find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, yeah, need you to stay, hey
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting, all theres left to do is run
Ill be the prince, youll be the princess
Its a love story, baby, just say Yes...
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh boy, for goodness sake
You think Im cryin on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
If you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
If you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
Ayo Dr. B Igmoney in de house
Ja bitch
Bigmoney komt je vertellen hoe het is
Ja die lagere klassen, die vind ik verderfelijk
En als tijd geld is, dan ben ik onsterfelijk
Maar als die uitspraak niet waardeert, meld het direct
Ik behandel al mijn critici met heel veel respect
Kan ik niks bedenken, dan geef ik een cadeaukaart
Een stom stukje plastic, maar hij is 5 euro waard
Ik heb belastingsfraude op m'n geweten
Maar vraag je ernaar, ja dan ben ik dat vergeten
En ben je op een dag op zoek naar Romijn
Doe maar geen moeite, hij kan niet ver zijn
Ik heb 0 bitches. 
Die bitches heb ik niet. 
Ik heb bitches niet nodig, ik beroof elke bank
En ik ging laatst naar Frank-rijk en nu heet hij Frank
Fucking idioot
Wie heet er nou Frank?
Kut naam
Hoor je dat Frank, je bent een hoer
Bitch
Kifesh met Frank
En je denkt nu misschien: 'is hij aseksueel?'
Nou nee bitch, ik ben aseksu-heel-rijk
Ik ben aseksu-heel-rijk
Aseksu-heel-rijk. 
Bitch
For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying on my own. Well, I aint

And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love. Now I feel nothin at all
And never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much

Im at a party I dont wanna be at
And I dont ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin if I could sneak out the back
Nobodys even lookin me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, Shall we dance? 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Dont think I fit in at this party
Everyones got so much to say 
I always feel like Im nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
Cause I dont care when Im with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And youre making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When Im with my baby, yeah
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm
Cause I dont care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And youre making me feel like Im loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When Im with my baby, yeah
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm
We at a party we dont wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we cant hear ourselves
Read your lips, Id rather kiss em right back
With all these people all around
Im crippled with anxiety
But Im told its where Im sposed to be
You know what? Its kinda crazy cause I really dont mind
When you make it better like that
Dont think we fit in at this party
Everyones got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said Im sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay
Cause I dont care when Im with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, youre making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when Im with my baby, yeah
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm
Cause I dont care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And youre making me feel like Im loved by somebody

Je suis perdu ou va tu me retrouver
Comme une bouteille jetee en mer ou vais, je echouer
Cet amour ce courage, je les ai delaisses
Je crois que mon coeur, cest abandonne
Oh, je ne comprends pas !!!!!!
Seigneur, je taime, mais test loi, je ne les respecte pas
Wooh, je ne comprends pas !!!!
Javance, mais pas du tout, car jai un poids
Un poids qui me tire vers le bas
Limportant ce nest pas la chute, mais latterrissage en bas
Ce monde mobscurcit
Combien de fois, jai songe le temps dun instant a moter la vie
Je crois, je suis incompris
Dans ce monde rempli de derive, je crois que ca mirrite oui, je suis incompris
Mes freres et soeurs, je vous aime
Mais reellement est ce que lon saide
Souvent ya rien de bon dans ce quon seme
On agie avec tellement de haine
Et cest a Dieu quon fait de la peine
Dans mon eglise, je recherche lunite
Mais jai bien limpression que le sheitan sen est empare
Je vais tout faire pour la recuperer
Meme si pour ca, je dois y laisser ma peau refre
Non, je ne veux plus avoir deux visages
Un pour leglise un pour le monde, mais quel drole dequipage
Je vois cette grace au bord du rivage
Le peche est sur la croix, il faut tourner la page
On doit tous marcher dans un meme corps
Nayant pas deux langages plusieurs manieres, on est daccord
Donc nos paroles faut quon les accorde...
Regarde ton voisin prend lui la main
On est une famille et ca, jen suis certain
Meme si cest la premiere fois bah que tu viens
Met toi alaise ta une nouvelle famille frangin
Pour finir
Quand tu tombes, sache quon tombe aussi
Lorsque test mal, cest toute la famille qui est mal aussi
Mais surtout ne cache pas ca par du mensonge
Car ce mensonge sera la cause de gens qui plonge
Dans le jugement et la lachete un mauvais songe
Ce son, cest une prise de conscience
Pourquoi je suis sur terre
Pourquoi je vis
Pourquoi ce ciel pourquoi cette mer ?
Non, on nest pas la par hasard
On a une mission a accomplir
Cest plus le temps de fuir
Car je la veux cette difference
Cette difference pour ma douce France
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I dont do too well with apologies
I hope I dont run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Everybody knows my name now
But something bout it still feels strange
Like lookin in the mirror trying to steady yourself
And seein somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when Im older, itll all calm down
But its killin me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call
Then maybe then youd know me
cause Ive had everything
But no ones listenin
Thats just fuckin lonely
Im so lo-o-o-o-nely
Lo-o-o-o-nely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house is always made of glass
And maybe thats the price you pay
For money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticize the things I did
As an idiot kid
I was a fuckin kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call
Then maybe then youd know me
cause Ive had everything
But no ones listenin
Thats just fuckin lonely
Im so lo-o-o-o-nely
Lo-o-o-o-nely
Lo-o-o-o-nely
Lo-o-o-o-nely
My Spell to Return a Lost Lover can bring back a lost love into your life and fix a broken relationship, no matter how difficult or severe the circumstances are. Although time can heal many wounds, there are wounds so deep they last lifetime. This Reuniting Love Spell has been specifically designed to help those in need of restoring love, whether from a recent split or a difficult breakup of many years. And the results are long-lasting and extremely powerful
There is no reason to be afraid. My magical spell can bring you and your loved one together without creating or using any negative energies
When should I use a Return Lost Lover Spell?
If your relationship is broken and you have lost your partner, the Return Lost Lover Spell can help bring that person back into your life
As sad as the circumstances may currently be for you, within the spiritual realm you will find hope and solutions to your problem. Even if you think right now that there is no way back and that love has died forever. This is very rarely the case, because most often only negative energies, blockages, accumulated negative feelings, external influences, and dissatisfaction overshadow the relationship. Especially in such cases, a Return Lost Lover Spell is highly beneficial, since all spiritual causes will be eliminated and the love will automatically be rekindled. https://www.worldlovespells.com/

Stacks up
Un cut unflavored
Signed delivered what

Empty shells n' such
Ballet
Ballet
Nutrcracker parade
And once is rained then maybe youll see
You're more than a shell to me
So the next time u crack a bag of plastic open
Dont try to sell me for the packaging
They'd package u up too if u came with a bunch of screws
So lemme crack u up and we'll stop at its funny
Cause thats what it was
Before u got serious after the breakup
And im just not that close to u to touch
You're nuts
But clearly ur up early enoguh for the two of us
Forward thinking
Minds on the future move
And everyone knows who you'd cue
If u weren't stuck directing from it
The cue the cue ah yes
Wait in line for u
Id wait in line for u too
If i dont know better
But i do
I know it starts where it isnt
Cause
Well
Ur not u anymore since
Lines started stacking papers on my desk as thick as fruit roll ups but it seems ur rolling less
So why dotn we roll in peace everybody
And tell me why youd take peace under love anyday
Is it because of the way its packaged to the taste
When like is all youll ever get from me
Like a taste
Take one
Just dont make me try it
Yuck
Id rather see a case on ur clutch
Shell me while ur at it
Like all those empty chests
Clung to the root of their vine
Spoken: Now ill tell u watch
Why dotn u crack open the pit of a flat note
Prunus persica
And not tell me to put a peach on the market
Princess

If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we could be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now
Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer
Some people separate, yeah
Don't think we should separate
When we both adore one another
You're a dream come true
We should start over brand new
That's what we oughta do, yeah
Sometimes the heart can see
What's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don't wanna see us together now
Cause we are strong enough to endure, oh
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now
Don't let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don't wanna be left with the question, why?
Let's be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?
Yeah, sometimes the heart can see
What's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don't wanna see us together now
Lets be strong enough to endure, oh
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

So deck the halls and all the rest
Warm me up, with your Christmas love
Hey angel in the snow, Im under the mistletoe

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think Im cryin on my own, well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song
Cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, Ill be movin on
And I think you should be somethin I dont wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on
But now I know, Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Come they told me, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
A newborn king to see, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
To lay before the king, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
Rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum
Rum-pa-pa-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum-pum-pum
Yeah, Im on the drum, yeah Im on the snare drum
Yeah, Im on the beat cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat cause Im playin for the Son
Playin for the King, playin for the title
Im surprised you didnt hear this in the Bible
Im so tight, I might go psycho
Christmas time so heres a recital
Im so bad like Michael
I know Im still young but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like cupid
Im the drummer boy so do it, do it
Little baby, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
I am a poor boy too, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
Thats fit to give our king 
Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum
Its christmas
And its time to give
I aint talkin bout toys I aint talkin bout gifts
Its not about what you spend
Its not about what you bought
Its about reaching out, touching lives and hearts
Got an elephant that I must address
People fighting over sales while theres kids homeless?
Hold up, wait a minute I think we lost focus
Bring back the magic, hocus pocus
One boy, one drum and he played for the king
He didnt have much but it meant everything
If he can play a drum then so can you
Let your heart beat a rhythm thats so brand new
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum
Vape nic, suck dick

With an unpolished finish but something catches
Belong to you cancel our dinner
Max and coraline feed jackys gerbil
Spend another day Im giving
These sheets are so close

Throw away everything Ive written you oh
Anything just like every single thing today
Thoughtless rhymes I know its hard
Be married, Im only halfway home
And I cant believe you got kicked
Off a date and dropped you stars
Who swayed to suede
Youll hear it all dont call
Throw away everything Ive written you oh
Anything just like every single thing today
Me back in time
Need you here I am drunk
The dream before we were fleeing
Scene goes frame by frame
Who swayed to suede
Youll hear it all dont call
Throw away everything Ive written you oh
Anything just like every single thing today
[Verse 1}

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when were feelin low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldnt be drowning on your own

I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know...

And I wanna lay with you til Im old, o-old

I used to believe
We were burnin on the edge of something beautiful 
Something beautiful
Selling a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle 
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heavens heartbreaking away
Never let you go, never let me down
Its been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Dont you give up 
I wont give up 
Let me love you
Let me love you
Dont you give up 
I wont give up 
Let me love you
Let me love you
Dont fall asleep
At the wheel, weve got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we were good enough
We were good enough
Say go through the darkest of days
Heavens heartbreaking away
Never let you go, never let me down
Its been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Dont you give up 
I wont give up 
Let me love you
Let me love you
Dont you give up 
I wont give up 
Let me love you
Let me love you
Never let you go
Never let you go, go
Never let you go
Never let you go, go
Never let you go
Go, never let you go

Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We dont care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go
Were falling apart, still we hold together
Weve passed the end, so we chase forever
Cause this is all we know
This feelings all we know

I get my weed from California 
I took my chick up to the North, yeah
